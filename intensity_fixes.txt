# Intensity Reason Fixes - All need to be condensed to 2 lines max (60 chars)

# Current long intensity reasons that need shortening:
1. "Perfect beginner introduction with walk-jog intervals that build endurance gradually without overwhelming new exercisers." → "Perfect beginner introduction with walk-jog intervals." ✅ DONE
2. "Gentle incline progression helps beginners build leg strength and cardiovascular endurance safely." → "Gentle incline progression builds leg strength safely." ✅ DONE
3. "Progressively increases speed while maintaining good recovery periods for intermediate fitness levels." → "Speed increases with recovery for intermediate fitness."
4. "Combines consistent running pace with challenging inclines to build both cardiovascular and muscular endurance." → "Running pace with inclines builds cardio and muscle."
5. "High-intensity sprints at 9.0 mph challenge maximum cardiovascular capacity and anaerobic power." → "High-intensity 9.0 mph sprints challenge max capacity."
6. "Extended tempo runs plus high-intensity hill sprints demand advanced cardiovascular fitness and mental toughness." → "Tempo runs plus hill sprints demand advanced fitness."
7. "Low-impact movement with gentle resistance changes, ideal for building cardio base without joint stress." → "Low-impact with gentle resistance, ideal for cardio."
8. "Moderate RPM variations help beginners learn rhythm control while building steady-state endurance." → "RPM variations teach rhythm and build endurance."
9. "Alternates between high resistance climbs and fast sprints to challenge both strength and speed." → "Alternates climbs and sprints for strength and speed."
10. "Direction changes engage different muscle groups while maintaining consistent cardiovascular demand." → "Direction changes engage muscles with cardio demand."

# Key intensity reason from screenshot:
"High-intensity sprints at 32 SPM demand maximum power output and anaerobic capacity from advanced rowers." → "High-intensity 32 SPM sprints demand max power output."
