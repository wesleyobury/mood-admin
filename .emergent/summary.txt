**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully performed another massive content and image update, adding over 60 new workouts and their corresponding images to the application's leg day sections. This involved heavy modifications to , , , and . A key event during the session was the agent initially misunderstanding the user's request for Glutes workouts, where it created new equipment types instead of adding workouts to existing ones. This required a significant rollback and correction after user feedback.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Updating the images for the 12 newly added Calf workouts in . This was the final content addition task for this session.
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Manual user testing is required to verify all the new content and images across the Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, and Calves sections.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1: (P0) Verify all new Legs content (Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, Calves).
  Issue 2: (P1) Fix video player positioning bug.
  Issue 3: (P2) Investigate the recurring Failed to fetch profile error.
  Issue 4: (P3) The Home page search sheet () does not render correctly on the web.
  Issue 5: (P4) The Custom Workouts admin widget is broken.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has added over 60 new workouts and their images across four different data files.
     - Next debug checklist: Ask the user to comprehensively review the Legs section in the app. Specifically, they should check:
        1. All new workouts are present under the correct equipment for Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, and Calves.
        2. All newly added images are correct.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will close out another massive content update task and confirm the data is correct.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (manual user testing)
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 2, 3, 4, 5:
     - Attempted fixes: None. These are critical, long-standing issues carried over from previous sessions and were not addressed for the fifth consecutive session.
     - Next debug checklist: Refer to the initial handover summary for detailed debugging steps for each issue.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? Fixing these will address significant technical debt, improve core app functionality, enhance UI/UX, and restore broken admin features.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Varies by issue.
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Verify All New Leg Content**: Get explicit confirmation from the user that all Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, and Calves updates are correct.
- **(P1) Address High-Priority Technical Debt**: After user confirmation, you MUST proactively present the list of pending critical issues (Video player positioning, Profile fetch error, Broken search sheet, Broken admin widget) and ask the user to prioritize which one to tackle next. Five sessions have now been spent entirely on content; it is critical to pivot back to fixing these bugs.
- **(P2) Refactor Equipment-to-Muscle-Group Mapping**: The agent's initial mistake with the Glutes workouts, where it tried to modify  and add new equipment, highlights the fragility of hardcoded UI logic. Propose a refactor to make these components more data-driven to prevent future bugs.

  - **File Modified**: 
- **Mistake & Correction**:
  - Initially, the agent misunderstood the user request and added new equipment types for Glutes, modifying  and  incorrectly.
  - After user correction, the agent successfully reverted all changes and correctly added the workouts to the existing equipment, demonstrating a learning and correction process.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The critical bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget, 429 errors) listed in the initial handover summary were ignored for a fifth straight session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - All P2-P5 issues listed in the All Pending/In progress Issue list section were present in the initial handover summary and remain unfixed.
  - The agent's initial attempt to add new equipment for Glutes and modify hardcoded UI files () is a recurrence of the architectural flaw identified in the previous session (brittle UI-data mapping).
  - Recurrence count: 10+ (for unfixed bugs)
  - Status: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Static Content Management**: All work involved editing large TypeScript data array files. No backend or database interaction occurred.
- **Brittle UI-Data Mapping**: The agent initially repeated a mistake from a previous session by attempting to modify hardcoded UI logic in . This was corrected after user feedback, but it underscores a recurring architectural weakness.

**key DB schema**
- No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Heavily updated with 24 new workouts and images.
- : Heavily updated with 24 new workouts and images.
- : Updated with 3 new workouts and images.
- : Heavily updated with 12 new workouts and images.
- : A single image URL was updated.
- : Was incorrectly modified and then reverted. It remains a file of interest due to its brittle, hardcoded logic.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- ****: The agent's initial error in this session proves again that the hardcoded equipment-to-muscle-group mapping is a source of bugs and misunderstanding. It should be refactored to be data-driven.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were used or modified.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **START HERE**: Your first task is to get confirmation from the user that all the extensive **Legs** updates (Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads, Calves) are correct. This is a massive amount of content across multiple files.
2.  **AGENT MISUNDERSTANDING (CONTEXT)**: Be aware that the agent initially misunderstood the user's Glutes request. It added *new equipment* instead of adding workouts to *existing* equipment, and had to perform a significant rollback. This highlights the importance of clarifying user intent before making large-scale changes.
3.  **PIVOT TO BUG FIXES (CRITICAL)**: For **five consecutive sessions**, the agent has focused solely on content updates while major pre-existing bugs have been ignored. Once the user confirms the content is correct, you **must** pivot the conversation to addressing this technical debt. Present the list of high-priority bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget) and ask the user which one you should fix next. Do not wait for the user to bring them up.

**documents created in this job**
- None.
