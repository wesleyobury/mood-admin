The AI engineer successfully addressed several user-reported UI/UX issues. Key achievements include the shortening of I want to build explosiveness to Build explosion across all relevant explosiveness path screens, along with corresponding fixes to progress bar icons and text. The engineer also refined the neon glow effect on home screen mood cards. A significant effort was made to fix the outdoor activity navigation dots, which were clickable but not swiping cards. This investigation uncovered a fundamental issue: only one workout was being displayed despite data containing more, hindering swipe functionality, and touch events for dots were not consistently registering in the React Native Web environment. Finally, the AI engineer successfully resolved the square-edged shadow issue on lazy path workout cards by standardizing  values.

The goal is a polished, native-feeling workout application. Initially, this involved implementing a Light weights path (renaming, equipment updates, UI consistency) and a Calisthenics path (new equipment/workout screens, detailed data, extensive UI/UX refinement like gold gradients, consistent images, and progress bar corrections). Most recently, an Outdoor path was created, including  (6 activity options, abbreviated header/progress bar text) and  (mirroring Calisthenics UI, 1/x counter, progress bar text fixes). Subsequent requests focused on: making outdoor path navigation dots swipeable, shortening I want to build explosiveness to Build explosion on progress bars (explosiveness path), fixing Weight Based Cardio text and duplicate bodyweight icons in explosiveness path workout guidance, lightening home screen mood card neon glow, and rounding square-edged shadows on lazy workout cards.

-   **Expo File-Based Routing ()**: For declarative navigation.
-   **React Native Components**: Fundamental UI building blocks (View, Text, FlatList, TouchableOpacity).
-   ** with Flexbox**: For managing responsive, mobile-first layouts.
-   **State Management (, )**: For dynamic UI updates and component state.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main entry point for tab navigation and mood card display.
    -   **Changes**: Updated I want to build explosiveness mood card title to Build explosion. Reduced  and  shadow properties (color, opacity, radius, offset, elevation) and / to lighten the overall glow effect.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Equipment selection screen for outdoor activities.
    -   **Changes**: Header subtitle changed to Get outside and progress bar's first step to Outside to prevent text wrapping.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays selected outdoor workouts with swipeable cards and navigation dots.
    -   **Changes**: Progress bar mood text abbreviated to Outside.  prop added to FlatList.  handler, manual scroll logic, and improved  touch target area were added during debugging the dot functionality. Debug logs were also added to trace data flow.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Screen for selecting bodyweight or weight-based explosiveness training.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to pass Build explosion as the  parameter.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Equipment selection for bodyweight explosiveness workouts.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use Build explosion for the mood title in the progress bar.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays weight-based explosiveness workouts.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to Build explosion.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays bodyweight explosiveness workouts.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to Build explosion. Identified to have the same FlatList dot-swiping issue as .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Screen displaying workout instructions and real-time progress.
    -   **Changes**: Removed hardcoded Weight Based Cardio text. Implemented dynamic icon selection for workout type in the progress bar (body icon for bodyweight, barbell for weight-based) to fix duplicate icons. Mood title now dynamically fetched from parameters.
-   ****, ****, ****, ****, ****, ****, ****:
    -   **Importance**: These files represent various lazy workout paths, including workout display and equipment/training type selection screens.
    -   **Changes**:  property in workout card styles was consistently reduced from  to  across all these files to fix square-edged shadows and ensure rounded corners.

-   **Progress Bar Standardization (Legs Path):**  needs its progress bar updated to the single-row icon-based format.
-   **Difficulty Parameter Display Bug**: The workout screen ( and ) still shows Beginner in the progress bar/badges even when an Intermediate difficulty parameter is passed via URL.
-   **Outdoor Activity Dots Swiping Functionality**: The dots are clickable but cards do not swipe; debugging revealed a potential data issue where only one workout is displayed despite more being available in .

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully fixed the square-edged shadow issue on lazy workout cards by reducing the  from  to  in , , , , , , and . This ensures visual consistency with other rounded cards. Prior to this, the engineer was debugging the outdoor activity dots issue in . While the UI elements for dots were verified, comprehensive debugging revealed that the  was only rendering one workout, preventing swiping. Console logs for dot click events were not being triggered, suggesting a deeper issue with touch detection or data filtering for multiple workouts.
