The previous AI engineer diligently focused on enhancing the MOOD app's Muscle gainer section, specifically for Shoulders and Chest paths, based on iterative user feedback. Initial work established UI/UX patterns, including 3-line workout summaries and detailed battle plans, and resolved a Rear Delt Fly Machine naming bug. Subsequent tasks involved extensive refactoring of  to standardize card dimensions, shorten  descriptions, and refine the progress bar layout to match the shoulders path (initially 3 icons per row). Later, the progress bar and workout cards (photos, alignment, content width, neon glow, icon colors) were standardized across Chest and Shoulders to precisely mirror the Cardio path, adopting a 4-icon-per-row progress bar and reduced padding. The latest critical task involved debugging and fixing equipment-to-workout mapping issues in the shoulders path, identifying and correcting name mismatches, adding missing workout data, and cleaning up unused equipment references. Despite these efforts, the last frontend test indicated persistent Routing/Navigation issues and Equipment filtering logic problems, which are the immediate remaining challenges.

The MOOD app provides personalized, dark-themed workout recommendations with gold accents and bottom tab navigation. The Muscle gainer section was expanded for Shoulders and Chest with the following requirements:
1.  **Equipment/Workout Screens:** Implement  and  with specific, alphabetized equipment and workout content.
2.  **UI/UX Standardisation:** Duplicate Chest UI/UX (swipeable cards, non-scrollable progress bar, start button) for Shoulders.
3.  **Content Formatting:** Workout cards display *exactly 3-line summaries* (), while detailed s are for guidance screens.
4.  **Equipment Naming Consistency:** Pec Dec Rear Delt Fly was standardized to Rear Delt Fly Machine, and later Pec dec machine was reverted for chest.
5.  **Chest Path Specifics:** Apply 3-line summaries, standardize card dimensions, shorten  to max 3 lines, update progress bar (initially 3 icons/row, then 4 icons/row like cardio path, smaller elements), add neon shading to cards.
6.  **Workout Card Title Standardisation:** All workout card titles (chest and shoulders) to be *1 line*.
7.  **Chest Card Visuals:** Photos on workout cards need rounded edges, same dimensions as i want to sweat path. Duration & intensity on same line below title. Intensity reason, description, start button to match photo width. Intensity icon text black, i icon yellow.
8.  **Chest Text Alignment:** Workout title, duration, 3-line description moved slightly left (6px padding) to match cardio path.
9.  **Shoulder Card Visuals:** Apply chest/cardio layout updates to shoulder cards: neon glow, matching picture dimensions, correct padding (elements not touching border), and content (title, duration, description, button) matching photo width.
10. **Shoulder Workout Display Bug:** Ensure all equipment in the shoulders path has workouts correctly linked and mapped, resolving No Workouts Found errors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving a critical bug in the Shoulders workout path. Users reported that a bunch of the workouts are not displaying for shoulders, specifically mentioning adjustable bench and crossover machine as missing. This indicated an issue with how equipment selections were linked to available workouts.

The AI engineer performed a thorough investigation, comparing equipment names from  (the selection screen) with the  fields within the workout data in . Several discrepancies were identified:
1.  **Case Mismatch:** 'Adjustable Bench' in the selection screen versus 'Adjustable bench' in the workout data.
2.  **Name Mismatch:** 'Cable Crossover Machine' in selection versus 'Cable machine' in workout data.
3.  **Missing Workouts:** Workouts for 'Landmine Attachment', 'Powerlifting Platform', 'Shoulder Press Machine', and 'Smith Machine' were present in the selection but lacked corresponding data in .
4.  **Redundant Data:** Equipment types like 'Platform / Step', 'Resistance bands', and 'Suspension trainer' were present in the workout data but not in the selection screen.

The AI engineer implemented fixes by:
-   Correcting the casing for 'Adjustable bench'.
-   Renaming 'Cable machine' to 'Cable Crossover Machine'.
-   Adding new workout entries for 'Landmine Attachment', 'Powerlifting Platform', 'Shoulder Press Machine', and 'Smith Machine' to .
-   Removing the redundant workout data (e.g., 'Platform / Step') and updating the  function to align with the current, corrected equipment list.

After these changes and a frontend restart, a re-test using the frontend testing agent for shoulders equipment mapping was conducted. However, this test **failed**, reporting Routing/Navigation issues and Equipment filtering logic problems, indicating that while some mapping issues were addressed, the root cause might persist or new issues were introduced, preventing full functionality. The task is currently paused at this point, awaiting further investigation into these reported navigation and filtering problems.
