The trajectory documents a highly iterative and methodical process of populating a React Native fitness app with workout images for the Build Explosion Based section. The user drove the process by providing image assets for each equipment type (Chains/Bands, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Landmine, Power Lifting Platform, and Trap Hex Bar) and each difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

A key discovery occurred early on. The AI initially searched for the workout data in a previously known file, , but failed. Through exploration, it uncovered a new architectural pattern: workout UI is in , while the corresponding data is in a separate  file. This data-view separation was a departure from the monoliths seen before.

The AI then systematically populated all 57 workouts in this new data file. A critical incident happened during the Power Lifting Platform update, where the AI accidentally wiped the data file. It correctly diagnosed the issue, called the , and successfully restored the file from git history, demonstrating robust error recovery.

The workflow consistently involved: receiving assets, locating the correct data objects in , executing  commands to add  properties, restarting the Expo server, and summarizing the progress for the user. The trajectory concludes immediately after the AI finishes updating the final Trap Hex Bar workouts and restarts the server, just before sending the final confirmation summary to the user.

The user's language is English, and all future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The project's objective is to visually enhance the Build Explosion Based section of a fitness application by adding illustrative images to every workout. The development process is entirely user-driven, with the user acting as the product owner, providing image assets and directing the AI engineer to update specific categories.

The core task involves editing a hardcoded workout database located in the frontend codebase. For each specified equipment type—Chains/Bands, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Landmine, Power Lifting Platform, and Trap Hex Bar—the engineer must insert the provided image URLs into the  field for all Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced workout variations.

This work follows the completion of other workout categories in previous sessions. The scope of this trajectory was to identify the correct data source for weight-based explosive workouts and systematically populate images for all of them, thereby completing a significant portion of the app's content and improving the user experience with clear visual guidance.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Data-View Separation**: Workout data is stored in a dedicated data file (), separate from the React Native component file that renders it.
- **Hardcoded Data Model**: All workout information, including exercises, descriptions, and image URLs, is stored in a large, exported TypeScript constant array within the data file.
- **Iterative, User-Driven Workflow**: Development proceeds in a strict cycle: receive user assets and instructions, perform targeted file edits, restart the server to apply changes, and summarize progress.

<code_architecture>
The architecture for this feature separates the data from the presentation layer. A central data file exports a large array of workout objects, which is then imported and rendered by a specific React Native screen component.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the most critical file for the work performed in this trajectory. It was discovered during this session and serves as the single source of truth for all workouts within the Build Explosion Based path. It contains a large constant, , which is an array of objects detailing all exercises for 6 different equipment types.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was the primary target of all edits. The  property was added or updated for all 57 workouts across all 6 equipment types (Chains/Bands, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Landmine, Power Lifting Platform, Trap Hex Bar) and their respective difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). A critical incident occurred where this file was accidentally wiped, but it was successfully restored from git history using a command provided by the .

- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This file is the React Native component responsible for rendering the UI for the Weight Based workouts. It imports the  from  to display the workout information.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was read to understand the application architecture but was not edited.

- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This file was relevant only at the beginning of the trajectory. The AI initially (and incorrectly) assumed the Weight Based workouts would be here, based on previous work patterns. Reading this file and finding no relevant section prompted the exploration that led to the discovery of the new data architecture.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: No changes were made to this file.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding pending tasks. The user's request to add images to the entire Build Explosion Based section, including all workouts for the final Trap Hex Bar equipment, has been fully completed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was the final completion of the **Trap Hex Bar** equipment category, which also marked the completion of the entire Build Explosion Based section.

1.  **Initial User Request**: The user provided an initial set of images for the Trap Hex Bar workouts. The AI updated 8 of the 9 workouts but noted that an image for Trap Bar High Pull was missing.
2.  **Final User Request**: The user provided a second batch of images, including the missing Trap Bar High Pull image and two improved images for advanced workouts (Heavy Jump Shrug Wave and Trap Bar Jump Cluster).
3.  **File Edited**: .
4.  **Actions Performed**: The AI executed three  commands to update the  for these three workouts, overwriting the previous generic images for the advanced workouts with the new, more specific ones.
5.  **Final Action**: After successfully updating the last remaining workouts, the AI restarted the Expo server with expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started to apply all changes.
6.  **Where the work left off**: The trajectory concludes immediately after the server restart confirmation message. The AI has not yet sent its final summary to the user to confirm the completion of the Trap Hex Bar section and the entire Weight Based category.

<optional_next_step>
Provide a final, comprehensive summary to the user confirming that all Trap Hex Bar workouts are updated and that the entire Build Explosion Based section is now complete.
