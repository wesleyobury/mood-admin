The AI engineer's work focused on standardizing the user experience for workout card swipe functionality and visual presentation across an Expo mobile application. Initially, the task involved fixing existing leg workout cards for proper swipe and dot indicator synchronization and duration text styling. This established a robust  implementation pattern using  and .

Subsequently, the engineer systematically extended this functionality to various new workout paths (Bodyweight Explosiveness, Lazy Path workouts, Calisthenics, Outdoor), ensuring all  implementations were consistent. The project then evolved into a series of UI refinements based on explicit user feedback. This included standardizing the swipe to explore section's golden gradient background height and dot spacing by implementing  styling, unifying dot sizes to 12x12px across all relevant workout cards, and meticulously adjusting  ,  , and  properties for precise visual parity across different muscle-group specific workout cards (Abs, Biceps, Triceps, Back, Chest, Shoulders), often involving iterative adjustments.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was performing iterative refinements to the visual styling of the swipe to explore section on specific workout cards. The user had reported that the golden shaded area for , , and  workout cards was still visually inconsistent in height compared to the  workout card, and later that the  card's shaded area was too tall compared to  and  workout cards.

The AI engineer's most recent actions (Chat Messages 215-222) involved:
1.  Identifying that  had  and  had  for their .
2.  Adjusting the  property within the  style for  from 20 to 16.
3.  Similarly updating  and  by setting their   to 16.

These changes were made to ensure a unified visual height for the swipe to explore golden shaded area across these muscle-group specific workout cards. The frontend was restarted after these modifications (Chat Message 223-226).
