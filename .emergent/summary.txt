**original_problem_statement**:
The user's primary goal for this session was to update the images for various workout cards within the Shoulders section of the application. This was an iterative process where the user provided images in batches for specific equipment types, and the agent was tasked with updating the corresponding data file to reflect these changes.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully processed numerous user requests to update specific workout card images in the  file. This file now contains many updated image URLs for various equipment types: Shoulder Press Machine, Rear Delt Fly, Smith Machine, Cable Crossover, Dumbbells, Barbell, Landmine Attachment, Adjustable Bench, Kettlebells, and Powerlifting Platform. After each batch of updates, the agent correctly restarted the frontend server.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent updated two final images based on the user's request: one for the Cable Raise + Face Pull Contrast workout and another for the Barbell Press Burnout workout. This involved modifying .
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by user
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Verify All Shoulder Workout Images**: Confirm with the user that the multitude of image updates made across all 10 shoulder equipment categories are displaying correctly in the app.
- **(P1) Address High-Priority Technical Debt**: After user confirmation of the image updates, you MUST proactively present the list of pending critical issues (Video player positioning, Profile fetch error, Broken search sheet, Broken admin widget) and ask the user to prioritize which one to tackle next.

**Completed work in this session**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Data Management**: The core task involved locating and updating specific string values (image URLs) within a large, nested TypeScript data object ().
- **Iterative Content Updates**: The agent handled a long series of user requests in small, sequential batches, updating content and restarting the server after each batch.

**key DB schema**
- No database schema changes were made. All work was on frontend data files.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : **The only file modified in this session.** It was repeatedly edited to replace placeholder image URLs with new ones provided by the user for the shoulder workouts.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None identified in this session.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were used or modified.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **START HERE**: Your first task is to get confirmation from the user that all the image updates for the Shoulders workouts are correct. They have been updated across 10 different equipment types.
2.  **PIVOT TO BUG FIXES (CRITICAL)**: This session was spent entirely on content updates, ignoring major pre-existing bugs. Once the user confirms the images are correct, you **must** pivot the conversation to addressing the technical debt. Present the list of high-priority bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget) and ask the user which one you should fix next. Do not wait for the user to bring them up.

**documents created in this job**

  - Known regressions: None from this session's work, but major pre-existing bugs remain unaddressed.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- Continue as a guest or log in to the application and navigate to the Shoulders workout section to view the updated images.

**What agent forgot to execute**

However, it completely ignored the critical, pre-existing bugs that were explicitly listed in the initial handover summary. The next agent's primary responsibility, after confirming the image updates, is to address this technical debt.
