The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer extending the Arms workout feature in a mobile fitness application. The preceding work involved creating a complex, animated, in-card UI for selecting Biceps or Triceps on the  screen. This summary covers the next logical step in the user flow.

The engineer's task, based on an explicit user request, was to create dedicated equipment selection screens for both biceps and triceps. The process began by duplicating the existing  file to create  and . These new files were populated with specific equipment lists provided by the user.

Following the creation of these screens, the engineer updated the navigation logic in . The  function was modified to route the user from the Bis" and "Tris buttons to the newly created  and  screens, respectively.

Finally, the engineer addressed a minor follow-up request from the user to rename a piece of equipment on the triceps screen from SA machine to Single extension cable. The work concluded after restarting the frontend service and verifying the application was running.

<product_requirements>
The MOOD application is a personalized workout planner with a distinct dark theme accented with gold. The core functionality provides workout recommendations based on user-selected goals, such as Muscle Gainer.

Initially, the app supported Shoulders, Chest, and Cardio workouts. Development recently expanded to include a full Back Workouts path, from equipment selection to workout display.

The current focus is on building out the Arms workout path. The previous engineer completed a sophisticated UI on the  screen, allowing users to select Biceps or Triceps within an animated, expanding card.

The latest requirements build on this foundation:
1.  **Create Equipment Screens**: For both Biceps and Triceps, create new equipment selection screens by duplicating the existing chest equipment screen.
2.  **Populate with Equipment**:
    *   **Biceps**: Dumbbell, EZ Curl Bar, SA Cable Machine, Preacher Curl Machine, Bicep Curl Machine, Pull Up Bar.
    *   **Triceps**: Dumbbell, Kettlebell, EZ Bar, SA Machine (later renamed Single extension cable), Cable Crossover Machine, Tricep Pushdown Machine, Dip Station / Machine, TRX Bands.
3.  **Implement Navigation**: Connect the Bis" and "Tris buttons on the  screen to navigate to their respective new equipment screens.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Mobile Frontend**: React Native, Expo framework.
- **File-based Routing**: Navigation handled by Expo Router, linking components in the  directory to specific routes.
- **Component Reusability**: Creating new features by duplicating and modifying existing components ( as a template).
- **Stateful Navigation**: Using component state () to determine navigation paths ( vs. ).
- **UI Styling**: Consistent UI achieved using React Native's  API.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo Router file-based routing architecture. All screens are located in the  directory.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: A new screen that allows users to select their available equipment for Biceps workouts, serving as a critical step in the Arms user flow.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: This file was newly created as a copy of . It was populated with a list of 6 specific pieces of equipment for biceps, as requested by the user.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: A new screen for selecting Triceps workout equipment, mirroring the functionality of the biceps and chest screens to maintain a consistent user experience.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: This file was newly created as a copy of . It was populated with 8 specific pieces of equipment for triceps. It was later modified to rename SA machine to Single extension cable and update its corresponding ID for consistency.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The central screen for muscle group selection and the entry point for the Arms workout path.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: The  function was updated. It now includes logic to check the  state. If 'biceps' is selected, it navigates to ; if 'triceps' is selected, it navigates to . This change connects the existing UI to the newly created screens.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Served as the foundational template for the new equipment screens, ensuring UI and functional consistency.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: This file was read to understand its structure but was not modified.

<pending_tasks>
- Create  and  screens to show the actual workouts.
- Populate the new workout display screens with detailed workout data (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) for all Biceps and Triceps equipment.
- Resolve outstanding Routing/Navigation issues and Equipment filtering logic issues from previous testing reports.
- Implement broader features like AI-powered recommendations, workout tracking, and social sharing.

<current_work>
The most recent work cycle focused on building the equipment selection stage for the Arms workout path, directly following the completion of the Biceps/Triceps selection UI on the  screen.

The engineer's actions were as follows:
1.  **Screen Creation**: Two new files,  and , were created by duplicating the  file.
2.  **Content Population**: These new screens were populated with user-specified equipment lists for biceps (6 items) and triceps (8 items), respectively. The items were ordered alphabetically for usability.
3.  **Navigation Implementation**: The  function in  was modified. Logic was added to use the  method to navigate to  or  based on the user's selection stored in the  state.
4.  **Refinement**: A small but important text correction was made in  based on direct user feedback, changing SA machine to Single extension cable to improve clarity.

The current state of the application now includes a functional, albeit incomplete, user flow for the Arms workout. Users can select Arms, then choose Bis" or "Tris, and be navigated to a dedicated screen to select their available equipment for that muscle group. The final step of displaying the workouts is pending.
