The AI engineer's work primarily focused on enhancing the MOOD app's UI/UX and data consistency, particularly within the Muscle gainer (Shoulders, Chest) and Cardio (Sweat Path) sections. Initial efforts included standardizing UI elements like workout cards and progress bars across Chest and Shoulders, and fixing equipment mapping bugs in the Shoulders path. A major part of the work involved refactoring cardio workout data in  to condense descriptions into 3-line summaries for cards and later re-implementing a separate  field for detailed instructions on guidance screens. This required modifying the  interface, , and the navigation logic. The trajectory also involved iterative visual bug fixes, such as adding a neon gold shading to  on chest/shoulders cards and later restoring a lost gradient background on cardio intensity reasons. Despite extensive data refactoring, initial routing/filtering issues remain.

<product_requirements>
The MOOD app offers personalized, dark-themed workout recommendations with gold accents. The Muscle gainer section was expanded for Shoulders and Chest, requiring:
1.  **Equipment/Workout Screens:** Implement  and  with specific, alphabetized equipment and workout content.
2.  **UI/UX Standardisation:** Duplicate Chest UI/UX (swipeable cards, non-scrollable progress bar, start button) for Shoulders.
3.  **Content Formatting:** Workout cards display *exactly 3-line summaries* (), while detailed s are for guidance screens.
4.  **Equipment Naming Consistency:** Standardize Pec Dec Rear Delt Fly to Rear Delt Fly Machine, and later revert Pec dec machine for chest.
5.  **Chest Path Specifics:** Apply 3-line summaries, standardize card dimensions, shorten  to max 3 lines, update progress bar (4 icons/row like cardio path, smaller elements), add neon shading to cards.
6.  **Workout Card Title Standardisation:** All workout card titles (chest and shoulders) to be *1 line*.
7.  **Chest Card Visuals:** Photos with rounded edges, duration & intensity on same line; content width matches photo; intensity icon text black, i icon yellow.
8.  **Chest Text Alignment:** Workout title, duration, 3-line description moved slightly left (6px padding) to match cardio path.
9.  **Shoulder Card Visuals:** Apply chest/cardio layout updates to shoulder cards: neon glow, matching picture dimensions, correct padding.
10. **Shoulder Workout Display Bug:** Ensure all equipment has correctly linked workouts.
11. **Cardio Path Enhancements:**
    *   Add light neon gold shading to bottom of workout cards (initially missing).
    *   Condense all cardio workout descriptions on your workouts screen to 3-line summaries.
    *   Restore full, bulleted battle plans on workout guidance screens (after accidental shortening).
    *   Display duration and intensity level on the same line on cardio workout cards.
    *   Change intensity level text font to black on cardio workout cards.
    *   Restore light neon gold gradient around intensity level reason/description on cardio workout cards.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a visual regression in the Sweat (cardio-based) path. Specifically, the user reported that the light neon gold gradient that previously surrounded the intensity level reason/description on the cardio workout cards had disappeared after recent styling updates. This was a critical UI bug requiring immediate attention.

The AI engineer identified that the , , and  properties for the intensity container had been inadvertently removed or overridden during the previous styling adjustments made to align the cardio cards with the chest and shoulders paths.

The fix involved restoring the following styles to the intensity container:
-    to bring back the light gold gradient.
-    and  for correct spacing.
-    for rounded corners.

This action aimed to reintroduce the missing gradient while preserving the other recent styling changes, such as duration and intensity on the same line, and black intensity text. The frontend service was restarted after these changes.

I will await user feedback to confirm the restored gradient appears correctly.
