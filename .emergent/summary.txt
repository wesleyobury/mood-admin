**original_problem_statement**:
The user's objective was to replace the existing shoulder workout data with a completely new and comprehensive set of workouts. This was provided in three separate batches, totaling 10 distinct equipment types, with 12 workouts for each type (categorized into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels). The agent's task was to parse this data, update the application's data source, and ensure the corresponding UI for selecting equipment was also updated to reflect these changes.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully processed all user requests to update the shoulder workouts. The data file  now contains all 120 new workouts across the 10 specified equipment types. The equipment selection screen, , has been updated to display these 10 options, ensuring correct names and icons. All changes have been followed by a frontend server restart.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Adding the final batch of three equipment types (Adjustable Bench, Kettlebells, Powerlifting Platform) to the  file and updating the  selection screen to include them.
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Manual testing by user. The user needs to navigate to the shoulder workout section and verify that all 10 equipment types are present and that selecting each one displays the correct new workout data.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1: (P0) Verify the new shoulder workout data.
  Issue 2: (P1) Fix video player positioning.
  Issue 3: (P2) Investigate the recurring Failed to fetch profile error.
  Issue 4: (P3) The Home page search sheet () does not render correctly on the web.
  Issue 5: (P4) The Custom Workouts admin widget is broken.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has implemented all requested data changes and UI updates.
     - Next debug checklist: Ask the user to test the shoulder workout flow in the app to confirm the data is correct.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will complete the user's primary feature request from this session.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (manual user testing)
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 2, 3, 4, 5:
     - Attempted fixes: None in this session. These are carry-over issues from the previous handover.
     - Next debug checklist: Refer to the handover summary provided in the initial message of this session (). The debugging steps for each are outlined there.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? These are long-standing, high-priority bugs that affect core app functionality, UI polish, and admin capabilities.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Varies by issue (see initial summary).
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Verify Shoulder Workouts**: Confirm with the user that all 10 new equipment categories and their corresponding 120 workouts are displaying correctly in the app.
- **(P1) Address Technical Debt**: After the user confirms the shoulder workouts are correct, proactively bring up the list of pending high-priority issues (Video player positioning, Profile fetch error, Broken search, Broken admin widget) and request user permission to prioritize and fix them.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Shoulder Workout Data Overhaul**:
  - Replaced the entire content of  with 120 new workouts across 10 equipment types as provided by the user.
- **Equipment Selection UI Update**:
  - Updated  to display all 10 new equipment categories.
- **Bug Fix - Data Mismatch**:
  - Debugged and resolved an issue where old workout data was displayed due to a name mismatch ( vs. ) and an outdated equipment list on the selection screen.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - All high-priority issues from the initial handover summary () were not addressed in this session, as the focus was entirely on the user's content update request. This includes:
     - **Issue 1**: Video Player Positioning Bug.
     - **Issue 2**: Failed to fetch profile Error.
     - **Issue 3**: Broken Homepage Search on Web.
     - **Issue 4**: Broken Custom Workouts Admin Widget.
     - **Issue 5**: Recurring API errors ().

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - Issue recurrence in previous fork: All P0-P5 issues listed in the initial handover summary were ignored and remain unfixed.
  - Recurrence count: 10+
  - Status: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Data Seeding/Management**: The core task involved parsing user-provided text and structuring it into a large TypeScript data object, then replacing the existing data file.
- **Debugging Data Flow**: The agent successfully diagnosed an issue where the UI was not reflecting the data backend. The process involved comparing component props () with the data source () to find inconsistencies.
- **Iterative Development**: The agent handled the user's request in three distinct batches, incrementally adding content and making adjustments based on feedback.

**All files of reference**
- : **Central file of this session.** Completely overwritten to contain the new shoulder workout data for 10 equipment types.
- : **Modified multiple times.** This file, which renders the equipment selection screen, was updated to include all 10 new equipment types and to fix a naming mismatch with the data file.
- : Viewed as a reference to understand the required data structure.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None identified in this session. The work was focused on data replacement rather than code logic.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were used or modified in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **START HERE**: Your first task is to confirm with the user that the new shoulder workout content is appearing correctly in the app. They need to check that all 10 equipment types are listed and that each one shows 4 workouts per difficulty level.
2.  **PIVOT TO BUG FIXES**: Once the user confirms the content is correct, you **must** pivot to addressing the long-standing technical debt. Present the list of high-priority bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget) and ask the user which one you should tackle next. Do not wait for the user to bring them up.

**documents created in this job**
