The trajectory details a systematic, repetitive task of populating image URLs for the Biceps workout section of a React Native application. Following a user request, the AI engineer identified that, similar to the previously handled Abs section, the workout data was hardcoded directly within a component file: .

The core workflow was executed for six distinct equipment types: Bicep Curl Machine, Cable Machine, Dumbbell, EZ Curl Bar, Preacher Curl Machine, and Pull Up Bar. For each equipment type, the user provided two images. The AI then performed six separate file edits to insert these image URLs into the  property for two workouts across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). This resulted in a total of 36 image URLs being added.

After completing the updates for each equipment type, the AI engineer consistently restarted the Expo server (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: ERROR (abnormal termination)) and provided a progress summary to the user. The trajectory concludes after the final equipment type (Pull Up Bar) was updated, a comprehensive summary of all biceps section updates was provided, and the AI prompted the user for the next task.

The primary goal is to visually enrich the application's Biceps workout section by adding specific images to workout cards. This task follows the same pattern as previously completed sections.

The core requirement is to populate workout cards with two distinct images for each of the six specified equipment types: Bicep Curl Machine, Cable Machine, Dumbbell, EZ Curl Bar, Preacher Curl Machine, and Pull Up Bar.

The implementation pattern involves a series of targeted file edits. For each equipment type, the first provided image is assigned to the first workout and the second image to the second workout. This pattern is repeated across all three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), totaling six  property updates per equipment type.

The overall objective, which has been fully accomplished according to the trajectory, was to populate all 36 workout cards in the Biceps section with these images, thereby improving the user experience and visual engagement. The system now awaits direction for the next workout section.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data in Component**: Workout data is not in a separate data file but is embedded as a constant () directly within the  React component.
- **Repetitive Code Modification**: Development consists of a systematic and repeated process of locating and updating empty  properties within a large, hardcoded data array.
- **Expo Development Workflow**: The standard procedure is to edit source code, restart the Metro bundler (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started), and then confirm the changes with the user.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture for workout content is based on hardcoding data directly into the relevant screen components. This creates a tight coupling between the UI and the data for each specific workout section.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the single most critical file for the Biceps section. It serves as both the React component for rendering the UI and the sole data source via the hardcoded  constant. This constant defines all equipment, workouts, descriptions, and image URLs for the entire Biceps section.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: This file was the exclusive target for all 36 image URL updates across the six Biceps equipment types. The AI engineer repeatedly located a specific equipment block (e.g., 'Bicep Curl Machine') and populated the empty  fields with the user-provided URLs. A total of 36  operations were performed on this file.

- There are no outstanding assigned tasks. All user requests to add images for the six specified equipment types in the Biceps section have been successfully completed. The system is awaiting the user's directive for the next task.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved completing the image population for the Biceps section. The final task was to update the Pull Up Bar workouts.

1.  **User Request**: The user provided two images for the Pull Up Bar equipment.
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI engineer located the  object within the  constant. It then executed six distinct  commands to insert the two provided image URLs into the  properties for the workouts under the , , and  intensity levels.
4.  **Final Action**: After the final image URL was added, the Expo server was restarted with expo: stopped
expo: started. The AI then provided a comprehensive summary to the user, confirming that all six equipment types in the Biceps section (totaling 36 workout cards) were updated. The work concluded with the AI asking the user to test the changes and provide instructions for the next workout section.
</current_work>
<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user that the Biceps section updates are satisfactory and ask for the next workout section they would like to work on (e.g., triceps, chest, back, legs).

<direct_quotes>
**User's last explicit request was to add images for the Pull Up Bar, which was completed.**

**AI engineer's last message, indicating the end of the task and asking for the next steps:** Please test these updates in your environment and let me know if everything is functioning as expected or if you would like to proceed with another workout section such as triceps, chest, back, legs, etc. I am available to assist with the next steps.
