The previous AI engineer successfully built the MOOD application from scratch, following an iterative development and bug-fixing process. Initially, the core app shell was developed, encompassing both a FastAPI backend (with authentication, workout, and social features) and an Expo React Native frontend (with welcome, login, register, and placeholder screens). The development then focused on implementing the user's explicit request for a home screen displaying 7 scrollable mood cards with gold neon accents and subtle animations.

A significant portion of the trajectory involved addressing critical UI/UX bugs. This included resolving a  import error, fixing home screen scrolling issues, removing an unwanted index header, and ensuring the app extended properly to the screen's edges (edge-to-edge display). The most challenging and persistent bug was the invisibility of the mood cards, which rendered but blended into the dark background. The engineer iteratively debugged and fixed this by adjusting card backgrounds and borders to be visible, simplifying animation logic, and removing problematic  components. Despite some premature declarations of success, the engineer eventually delivered a fully functional and visually appealing home screen with interactive mood cards.

The MOOD application is a mobile app designed to provide personalized workout recommendations (up to 90 minutes) based on user mood, fitness goals, skill level, and available equipment. The application features a dark aesthetic with gold accents and a bottom navigation bar with three primary sections: Workouts, Explore, and Profile.

The core feature is the Workouts home screen, which displays 7 distinct mood cards. These cards correspond to specific workout intentions: i want to sweat, i want to push and gain muscle, i want to build explosiveness, i want a light sweat, im feeling lazy, i want to do calisthenics, and i want to get outside.

In addition to workout recommendations, the app incorporates social media functionalities similar to Instagram, including user feeds, profiles, content posting, following, and commenting.

For workout generation, the user opted for an optimized hybrid approach, combining a curated exercise database with selective AI-powered workout combinations, prioritizing safety and cost-effectiveness.

The current implementation includes a complete app shell with:
- A functional backend (FastAPI + MongoDB) handling authentication, workout, and social features.
- A frontend (Expo + React Native) with an edge-to-edge dark theme, a welcome screen, full authentication flow (login/register), bottom tab navigation placeholders, and a home screen featuring the 7 mood cards.
- The mood cards are now visible, scrollable, animated, and styled with gold neon accents, satisfying the explicit user requests.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Mobile Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation (stack and tab navigation),  (animations),  (safe area handling),  (HTTP client).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python web framework), MongoDB (NoSQL database), JWT (JSON Web Tokens for authentication).
- **Core Feature**: Hybrid AI approach for personalized workout generation (currently a curated database with AI integration planned).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   
    -   **Importance**: This file implements the FastAPI backend, defining all API endpoints for user authentication (registration, login with JWT), workout data management (CRUD operations), and social features (posts, likes, comments). It handles interaction with the MongoDB database.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation with schemas for users, workouts, posts, comments, and the complete authentication logic.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the root layout for Expo Router. It configures global navigation (), integrates the , , and . It also manages the global  appearance and header visibility.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to resolve  import issues, hide default headers (removing the index text), configure the  for a pure black background and translucent effect, and wrap the app in  for edge-to-edge layout.
-   
    -   **Importance**: This is the initial entry point of the application, presenting the welcome screen with Get Started, Login, and Try Demo buttons. It handles the initial routing based on user authentication status.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented logic for redirecting authenticated users, added the Try Demo button for direct access to the mood cards, and included temporary auto-redirects during debugging.
-    (implicitly the  screen for mood cards)
    -   **Importance**: This is the main screen displaying the 7 mood cards, which are central to the app's functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to render the 7 mood cards in a single scrollable column. It implemented  for proper edge-to-edge display and dynamic padding. Crucially, it underwent several iterations to fix the mood cards' visibility, including removing a problematic , simplifying animation logic (removing  opacity), setting solid visible backgrounds (), enhancing gold borders, and ensuring all content scrolled correctly.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Manages the global authentication state for the frontend. It provides , , and  functions, storing user tokens securely using .
    -   **Changes Made**: Verified and ensured correct API URL usage for authentication calls.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Centralized stylesheet for the entire frontend, defining the dark aesthetic with gold accents, neon glow effects, and layout properties for various components.
    -   **Changes Made**: Numerous modifications to implement the dark neon gold aesthetic, including setting global backgrounds to pure black (), enhancing  effects, refining text shadows, and most importantly, adjusting  styles to have visible backgrounds () and prominent gold borders () to resolve the invisibility bug.
-   
    -   **Importance**: A Python script used to populate the MongoDB database with initial sample workout data for the 7 mood categories.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and executed to seed the database with predefined workout structures.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement workout detail screens when a mood card is tapped.
- Fully integrate the AI-powered workout recommendations (the hybrid approach is set up, but full dynamic generation is pending).
- Add workout tracking and progress analytics features.
- Implement push notifications for workout reminders.
- Enhance social features with workout sharing and challenges.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical bug: the 7 mood cards on the home screen were not visible, appearing as a black blank space beneath the Choose your mood text, despite being rendered in the component tree. This issue stemmed from a combination of the cards' background blending with the app's pure black theme, and conflicts with the  and  opacity used for animations.

The engineer addressed this through several targeted fixes:
-   **Visibility Enhancement**: The primary fix involved changing the  style in  to use a solid visible background color () instead of relying solely on , which was causing rendering issues.
-   **Animation Simplification**: Complex opacity animations using  that started at 0 were removed from the  component in  to prevent initial invisibility.
-   **Border & Icon Clarity**: Gold borders () were strengthened (increased to 3px width), and icons and text within the cards were explicitly set to gold or white to ensure high contrast against the new gray background.
-   **Gradient Removal**: The  component was entirely removed from the  rendering in  to eliminate a source of rendering conflicts.

As a result, all 7 mood cards are now perfectly visible, scrollable, and interactive on the home workouts tab, featuring gray backgrounds, prominent gold borders, gold icons, and white text, all within the requested dark neon aesthetic with an edge-to-edge display.
