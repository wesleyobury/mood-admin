The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the MOOD app, primarily focusing on two distinct phases. Initially, the work involved extensive UI/UX standardization across workout cards, addressing padding, spacing, neon glow effects, and particularly troubleshooting persistent Start Workout button positioning issues in weight-based paths within . This phase was characterized by iterative adjustments based on user screenshots and attempts to use the testing agent. The second, more recent phase, initiated by a user request, involved adding detailed  fields to all weight-based workouts in  within . The AI systematically identified and updated 10 equipment types (e.g., Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Barbells) across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, ensuring full battle plans are available on guidance screens while maintaining condensed summaries on workout cards. This task concluded with 100% completion of battle plan integration for all weight-based workouts.

The MOOD app aims to provide personalized, dark-themed workout recommendations with gold accents, categorized into Muscle Gainer (Shoulders, Chest) and Cardio (Sweat Path). Key requirements from the user included:
1.  **UI/UX Standardization**: Consistent design for workout cards, including padding, spacing (25px), neon glow effects, and border styling across Cardio, Chest, and Shoulder paths.
2.  **Content Summarization**: Cardio intensity descriptions condensed to a maximum of two lines. HIIT Ski battle plans to have specific content.
3.  **Weight Workout Display**: Replace  fields with one-line summaries on workout cards (two-line display), while preserving s for detailed guidance. Adjust spacing, padding, and overall card height to match other paths.
4.  **Button Positioning**: Center the Start Workout button on weight-based cards, consistent with Cardio, Chest, and Shoulder layouts. Resolve issues where the button was positioned too far down.
5.  **Font Consistency**: Standardize font sizes for intensity level, battle plan, and Start Workout button across all paths.
6.  **Text Formatting**: Remove italicization from battle plan summaries in the I want to sweat path.
7.  **Missing Battle Plans (New Request)**: Add full, detailed battle plans for all workouts in the sweat based path to be displayed on the workout guidance screen, following established instruction, movement, and rest format, while keeping condensed summaries on the your workouts screen.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that the Start Workout button on weight-based workout cards was positioned too far down. The last attempted fix involved removing  from  (setting it to ) and removing  from  entirely in , aiming for a natural flex layout. The AI had just invoked the testing agent to verify this fix and was awaiting results.

Subsequently, the user introduced a new, critical task: the sweat based path workouts were missing full  details on the workout guidance screen, although the condensed summaries on workout cards were correct. The AI engineer proceeded to implement this, systematically adding the missing  fields to  within . This involved:
1.  Identifying all 10 types of weight equipment (Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Barbells, Med balls, Slam balls, Battle ropes, Sled, Resistance bands, Sledgehammer & tire, Flipping Tire).
2.  Iteratively adding detailed  content for each workout across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, ensuring the format (instructions, movements, rest separated by line indentations in bullet format) matched other finalized paths.
3.  The task involved numerous  operations and occasional frontend service restarts. The AI encountered and navigated through screenshot issues during initial verification attempts but continued with the user's confirmation. The trajectory concludes with the AI declaring 100% completion of this task.
