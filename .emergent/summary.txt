The AI engineer's initial work (pre-trajectory) focused on implementing the Lift weights path, including Upper body, Lower body, and Full body workout screens, ensuring navigation and UI consistency. The current trajectory addressed a critical user-reported issue: the I want to sweat > Weight Based path incorrectly displayed Build Explosiveness content due to a naming conflict.

The AI engineer systematically fixed this by:
1. Renaming Weight Based to Light weights in .
2. Updating  with the correct equipment list, descriptions, and mood references for Light weights.
3. Creating a new file, , populated with extensive, user-provided Light weights workout data (Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Barbells, etc., across three difficulty levels).
4. Updating  to navigate to this new .
5. Performing comprehensive verification of navigation, equipment selection, and workout content display.
6. Addressing user feedback to implement missing UI/UX elements (padding, gold gradients, Swipe to explore section) in  to ensure visual parity with existing workout screens.

<product_requirements>
The application provides a native-feeling workout experience. The current enhancement focuses on the I want to sweat path.

Key requirements addressed in this trajectory:
1.  **Issue**: The I want to sweat > Weight Based path was displaying content intended for the Build Explosiveness path, caused by a naming overlap.
2.  **Rename**: Change Weight Based to Light weights within the I want to sweat path to prevent future confusion.
3.  **Content Reimplementation**: Replace the incorrect equipment and workout content with specific Light weights data.
    *   **Equipment**: DUMBBELLS, KETTLEBELLS, BARBELLS, MEDICINE BALLS, SLAM BALLS, BATTLE ROPES, SLED, SLEDGEHAMMER + TIRE, FLIPPING TIRE.
    *   **Workouts**: Provide comprehensive workout data for each equipment type, categorized by Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulty levels, including titles, durations, intensity, summaries, MOOD tips, and Battle Plans.
4.  **UI/UX Consistency**: Maintain the existing equipment screen, your workouts screen, and workout card format/layout, including adding missing elements like padding, gold gradients, and a swipe to explore section, ensuring parity with other workout displays.

<code_architecture>

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Screen for selecting general workout categories.
    -   **Changes**: Renamed Weight Based option to Light weights to resolve naming conflict.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Equipment selection screen for Weight Based (now Light weights) path.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with the correct list of 9 equipment types (Dumbbells, Kettlebells, etc.) relevant to Light weights. Modified difficulty level descriptions, section titles, mood references, and section description text to align with the sweat path. Updated navigation logic to point to .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Previously held incorrect workout content for I want to sweat path.
    -   **Changes**: This file's content was effectively superseded by the creation of .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: *New file* created to display specific workouts for the I want to sweat > Light weights path. Contains comprehensive workout data for 9 equipment types across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulties.
    -   **Changes**: Created by duplicating  structure and heavily modified. Populated with detailed workout data. Implemented UI/UX improvements: added padding below the progress bar, integrated gold gradients at the top and bottom of workout cards, applied a gold gradient behind the intensity reasoning text, and included a Swipe to explore section with navigation dots.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Served as a reference/template for UI/UX patterns (gradients, swipe indicators) for .
    -   **Changes**: No direct changes were made to this file; it was used for reference.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Progress Bar Standardization (Legs Path):**  needs its progress bar updated to the single-row icon-based format.
-   **Difficulty Parameter Display Bug**: The workout screen () still shows Beginner in the progress bar and badges even when an Intermediate difficulty parameter is passed via URL.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed implementing and verifying UI/UX improvements for the  screen. This work addressed explicit user feedback regarding missing styling elements to ensure visual parity with other workout displays in the application.

The steps taken and verified were:
1.  **Reference Existing Styles**: The AI engineer examined  to understand the correct styling patterns for gradients, spacing, and swipe indicators.
2.  **Add Padding Below Progress Bar**: Implemented appropriate  to the scroll content container in  to create clear spacing between the progress bar and the first workout card.
3.  **Add Swipe to Explore Section**: Incorporated the Swipe to explore text with navigation dots ( and related JSX/styles) at the bottom of each workout card section, including active dot highlighting.
4.  **Add Gold Gradient to Intensity Reasoning**: Applied a golden background gradient to the intensity reasoning text section, enhancing its visual presentation.
5.  **Add Gold Gradients to Workout Cards**: Integrated golden background gradients to the equipment headers (e.g., Dumbbells, Kettlebells) and the Swipe to explore sections at the bottom of the cards.
6.  **Frontend Restart and Verification**: The Expo frontend was restarted, and the  screen was thoroughly tested by navigating to . Screenshots confirmed all implemented UI/UX improvements (padding, all gradient applications, Swipe to explore sections with dots, and overall styling consistency) were working correctly across multiple equipment sections.
