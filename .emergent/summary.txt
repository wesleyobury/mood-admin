The trajectory details the AI engineer's transition to a new set of tasks after completing initial text standardization on workout cards. The primary focus shifted to implementing the Weight Based path within the Build Explosiveness feature. The AI successfully created/modified  by duplicating , populating it with new equipment, ensuring alphabetical order, consistent styling, and correct navigation to . Subsequently, the AI generated  based on , inserting specific Power Lifting Platform workout data. However, the user clarified that the workout card UI/UX in  needed to *exactly* match the  design. The AI is currently in the process of extracting the detailed  component structure and associated styles from  to replicate it precisely.

The application delivers native-feeling workout guidance, with existing Legs and Abs paths featuring equipment selection, hardcoded data, and swipeable workout displays. Recent requirements included:
1.  Extend bidirectional swipe and clickable dots to all muscle gainer and i want to sweat workout cards.
2.  Standardize progress bars in muscle gainer and i want to sweat paths to the single-row Abs format.
3.  Implement a new Build Explosiveness Path:
    -   Remove I want a light sweat card from the home screen and add a Build Explosiveness entry point.
    -   Create workout type selection (Body weight, Weight based).
    -   For Body weight, develop an equipment selection screen (Battle Ropes, Plyo Box, Bodyweight Only, Med Ball, Sled, Kettlebell, Sandbag) and corresponding Your Workouts screens with 3 swipeable cards per intensity per equipment, replicating existing UI/UX.
    -   For Weight based, create an equipment selection screen with Power Lifting Platform, Landmine Attachment, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Chains / Bands, Trap Hex Bar. Implement Your Workouts for Power Lifting Platform with 4 swipeable cards per intensity level, exactly replicating design specifications (layout, spacing, format, padding, height, photos, fonts, gradients, button, swipe function).
    -   Integrate comprehensive, hardcoded workout data and standardize mood card/header text to Build Explosive.

<current_work>
The immediate previous work involved standardizing the  and  text fields in  to ensure a consistent two-line display across all Sandbag (70-80 characters) and other bodyweight equipment workouts (60-70 characters).

Subsequently, the AI engineer began implementing the Weight Based explosiveness path. This involved:
1.  ** Creation/Update**: Duplicated from , updated with new equipment types (Power Lifting Platform, Landmine Attachment, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Chains / Bands, Trap Hex Bar), alphabetized them, and adjusted its UI/UX to match the bodyweight counterpart, including mood text (Build Explosive), difficulty levels, subtitles, progress bar icon (flash), and equipment card styling.
2.  **Navigation Integration**: Updated  to correctly navigate to .
3.  ** Creation**: Created this new screen by duplicating the structure of  and populated it with the provided 12 hardcoded Power Lifting Platform workouts (4 each for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulties).
Currently, the AI is focused on a user-requested refinement: to precisely replicate the UI/UX of the workout cards in  to exactly match the design found in . The AI is actively inspecting  to extract the  component and its associated styles.
