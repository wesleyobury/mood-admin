The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's transition from previous UI/UX standardization and battle plan integration to a new feature: implementing Back Workouts within the Muscle Gainer mood card. The work commenced with creating a  screen, duplicating the chest path, and precisely configuring equipment icons through multiple user feedback loops. Subsequently, the AI duplicated the your workouts and workout guidance screens for the back path via , integrating detailed barbell workout data. The latter half of the trajectory involved extensive UI/UX debugging for these barbell workouts, addressing issues such as missing swipe functionality, incorrect icon choices, inconsistent intensity icon colors and container backgrounds across difficulty levels, and text wrapping in the progress bar. Each fix involved iterative adjustments, comparisons with chest/shoulder path styling, and screenshot verification, culminating in pixel-perfect visual consistency for barbell back workouts.

The MOOD app provides personalized, dark-themed workout recommendations with gold accents, initially focusing on Muscle Gainer (Shoulders, Chest) and Cardio (Sweat Path). Initial requirements included UI/UX standardization (padding, spacing, neon glow, borders), content summarization (Cardio, Weight workout descriptions), precise button positioning (Start Workout), font/text consistency, and the crucial addition of detailed s for all weight-based workouts on the workout guidance screen, while maintaining condensed summaries on workout cards.

The most recent development cycle focused on extending Muscle Gainer to include **Back Workouts**. This involved:
1.  **Back Equipment Selection Screen**: Duplicate the chest path's equipment screen, listing specific back equipment (barbell, kettlebells, roman chair, adjustable bench, etc.) in alphabetical order.
2.  **Icon Accuracy**: Ensure all equipment icons are highly representative and intuitive (e.g., barbell icon shows a bar, Roman chair shows a 100-degree angle).
3.  **Workout Display & Guidance Duplication**: Duplicate your workouts and workout guidance screens from chest/shoulder paths for the back path, using its own data.
4.  **Barbell Workout Data**: Integrate detailed barbell workout data (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) with specific titles, durations, intensity reasoning, summaries, MOOD tips, and instructions/battle plans.
5.  **UI/UX Consistency (Barbell)**: Replicate chest path's styling precisely, including progress bar formatting, workout card height, overall styling (borders, colors, shading), picture formatting, workout title/duration/intensity positioning, button formatting, swipe features, timer positioning, battle plan formatting, and MOOD tip formatting.
6.  **Progress Bar & Icon Fixes**: Ensure progress bar is compact (4 icons per row), workout card photos have correct dimensions without overflow, intensity icon color is consistent yellow-gold, difficulty badge color is consistent yellow-gold, and progress bar text (Intermediate) fits on a single line across all relevant paths (Back, Chest, Shoulders).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several UI/UX inconsistencies reported by the user for the newly implemented back barbell workouts, aiming for pixel-perfect duplication of the chest/shoulder path's styling.

The specific issues and their resolutions were:
1.  **Progress Bar Text Wrapping**: The Intermediate text in the progress bar was breaking onto two lines. The fix involved updating  for  from 60 to 70 in , , , and  to ensure it fits on a single line, matching the cardio path. This was the final completed fix.
2.  **Difficulty Badge Color**: The INTERMEDIATE and ADVANCED difficulty badges on workout cards were showing orange and dark gold backgrounds, respectively, instead of a consistent yellow/gold. This was fixed by changing the  for the difficulty badge to a hardcoded  in , ensuring all badges are consistently yellow/gold.
3.  **Intensity Container Background/Border Color**: Despite previous attempts, the background and border of the intensity container were still visually inconsistent (appearing orange/darker) for intermediate and advanced levels compared to beginner and chest/shoulders. This was resolved by applying explicit inline style overrides with  and  directly to the intensity container  in  to ensure vibrant yellow-gold consistency.
4.  **Intensity Icon Color**: The information-circle icon within the intensity container had subtle color inconsistencies across difficulty levels. This was fixed by applying an explicit inline  to the icon in .
5.  **Progress Bar Height and Image Dimensions**: Earlier in the process, the progress bar was too tall, and workout card images were overflowing. These were fixed by standardizing progress bar icon sizes (24x24) and  dimensions, and setting workout image dimensions to  and  in .

The current state is that the back barbell workouts now feature complete UI/UX consistency, including swipe functionality, proper content display, and pixel-perfect styling, aligning with the chest and shoulder paths.
