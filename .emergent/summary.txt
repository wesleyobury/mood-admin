The trajectory outlines a highly iterative UI debugging and alignment process across multiple React Native components. The user's primary goal was to achieve visual consistency for workout cards and progress bars across three different sections of the app: Abs, Cardio Based, and Light Weights.

The AI engineer's work began by synchronizing the Abs workout card () with the Cardio Based card (). This involved a series of adjustments to card height, button placement, and the swipe to explore dot indicators, often requiring multiple attempts and pixel-level fine-tuning based on user feedback.

Subsequently, the scope expanded to unifying a progress bar component across all three paths. This proved complex, as the Light Weights path () used a different component structure ( vs. ) and had subtle but significant style differences (e.g.,  width). The AI initially made several incorrect fixes, such as adding a fixed height that caused other layout issues, but eventually identified and corrected the root structural and styling discrepancies. The final action was an attempt to fix a horizontal overflow issue in the light weights progress bar.

The user's primary language is English, and future interactions should continue in English.

The primary goal is to enforce visual and layout consistency for UI components across different workout paths within the fitness application.

**Problem:** Key UI elements—specifically workout cards and progress bars—have inconsistent styling, dimensions, and spacing across the Abs, I want to sweat, Cardio Based, and I want to sweat, Light Weights sections of the app. This leads to a disjointed user experience.

**Implementation So Far:**
1.  **Abs vs. Cardio Cards:** The Abs workout cards in  were modified to match the Cardio cards in . This involved adjusting container height, button margins, and dot indicator styles.
2.  **Progress Bar Standardization:** The progress bars in the Cardio and Light Weights paths were updated to match the height and font size of the Abs path.
3.  **Light Weights Progress Bar:** A significant effort was made to fix the Light Weights progress bar, which was structurally different, causing it to scroll or be cut off. It was refactored to match the structure of the Cardio path's progress bar.

The overall task is a pixel-perfect UI alignment effort driven by iterative user feedback.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Native Styling (StyleSheet):** Extensive, iterative use of  to modify , , , , , and shadow properties to match a reference design.
- **Comparative Debugging:** Methodically comparing two or more  files side-by-side to identify and reconcile differences in JSX structure and  properties.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Heavy reliance on Flexbox properties (, , ) and debugging their behavior, especially regarding wrapping and overflow.
- **Component Refactoring:** Replacing a  with a -based structure to fix a layout issue and match a reference component.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Expo Router file-based routing structure. All modifications were focused on the frontend components within the  directory.

**Directory Structure:**


   - ****
      - **Importance:** This file renders the Abs workout path. It was the primary target for the initial set of UI alignment tasks to make it match the cardio path.
      - **Summary of Changes:** Underwent numerous style changes. Key edits include: setting  height to ; adjusting  margins multiple times (ending at ); and adding missing styles for  and  to create a glow effect.

   - ****
      - **Importance:** This file, rendering the Cardio Based path, served as the primary visual source of truth or template for most of the UI alignment tasks.
      - **Summary of Changes:** This file was edited to standardize its styles with other paths. Changes include: reducing  padding, reducing   to , and decreasing the card's shadow/glow effect to match the light weights path.

   - ****
      - **Importance:** This file renders the Light Weights path. It became the focus of the most recent and complex work, particularly regarding its progress bar.
      - **Summary of Changes:** The progress bar was significantly refactored. A  was replaced with a  to match the cardio path's structure and prevent content from being cut off. Numerous styles were adjusted to fix wrapping and overflow issues. The last change was to the  width to prevent horizontal overflow.

<pending_tasks>
- **Final User Confirmation:** The main pending task is to get confirmation from the user that the progress bar in the Light Weights path is no longer cut off on the right side and correctly displays all four icons on a single line after the latest adjustments.

<current_work>
The immediate last task was to fix a layout issue where the progress bar in the Light Weights path () was being cut off on the right side, even after its structure was refactored to match the cardio path. The user reported that the 2 Equipment item was not fully visible.

Upon investigation, the AI discovered two key style discrepancies causing the horizontal overflow:
1.  The  (the line between icons) had a , which was almost double the  used in the cardio path.
2.  The  had a  constraint that was removed to allow more flexible text fitting.

The final action was to edit  to change the  width from  to . The Expo server was then restarted to apply the changes. The application is now waiting for user feedback to confirm if this fix has resolved the cutoff issue.

<optional_next_step>
I will ask the user to check their device preview and confirm if the Light Weights progress bar is now fully visible and no longer cut off on the right side.
