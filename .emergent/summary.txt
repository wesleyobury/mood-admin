The trajectory outlines an iterative development process for adding a Glutes workout section to an existing Legs workout path in a mobile application. The initial request was to add a large, detailed database of Glutes workouts, mirroring the structure of the existing Compound workouts, and display them on the same screen.

The development cycle involved several rounds of user feedback and subsequent refinements. The first phase focused on adding the raw workout data for Glutes into the  file and updating the navigation and UI logic in  to handle the new muscle group.

Subsequent user requests highlighted multiple UI/UX and data accuracy issues. These included:
1.  Updating the Intensity Reasoning and Workout Summary text for all Glutes workouts with improved content.
2.  Fixing UI inconsistencies, such as workout card height and button spacing, particularly for the Trap Bar exercises.
3.  Correcting text formatting within the Battle Plan sections (e.g., ensuring drop sets were bulleted, not bolded).
4.  A significant redesign of the top progress bar to prevent it from becoming too long, by limiting it to two rows and grouping equipment selections under their parent muscle group icon.

The AI engineer addressed these issues through a series of targeted file edits, primarily within , followed by frontend service restarts to apply the changes. The process demonstrates a reactive workflow, with each step directly addressing a specific user-reported problem.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to expand the Legs workout feature by incorporating a new, comprehensive Glutes section that integrates seamlessly with the existing Compound workout flow.

**Core Feature Requirements:**
1.  **Glutes Workout Database:** Implement a detailed database for Glutes workouts, categorized by equipment type (Single Stack Cable Machine, Hip Thruster Equipment, etc.) and difficulty level (Beginger, Intermediate, Advanced). This data includes titles, durations, intensity reasoning, summaries, and detailed Battle Plans.
2.  **Unified Workout Display:** Display the newly added Glutes workout cards on the  screen, directly following any selected Compound workout cards.
3.  **UI/UX Consistency:** Ensure all new Glutes workout cards maintain the same visual styling, height, and layout as the existing Compound cards. The spacing for elements like the Start Workout button must be identical.
4.  **Content Accuracy:** The text for Intensity Reasoning and Workout Summary must be updated to match the specific, improved versions provided by the user.
5.  **Progress Bar Enhancement:** The progress bar at the top of the workout display screen must be constrained to a maximum of two rows (eight icons). When more than eight items are selected, individual equipment selections must be consolidated and represented by their parent muscle group icon to maintain a clean UI. Any duplicate icons (e.g., Legs) must be removed.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Static Data Management:** The entire workout database for both Compound and Glutes exercises is hardcoded as a large JavaScript object within the  file.
- **Component-Based UI (React Native):** The application is built using React Native components. The work involved modifying existing components to handle and display new data structures.
- **Conditional Rendering & Styling:** Logic was implemented to conditionally render workout sections based on user selections and to fix layout issues (e.g., card height) caused by variations in data content and formatting.

<code_architecture>
The architecture is based on Expo's file-based routing. The recent work was heavily concentrated on modifying the workout display screen to incorporate new data and fix UI issues.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This screen is the user's entry point for selecting equipment for the Legs path. Its navigation logic determines which workouts are passed to the display screen.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The file was modified to ensure that selecting Glutes equipment correctly routes the user to the  screen. Logic was also updated to conditionally show the Intensity Level selector when Glutes equipment is chosen, in addition to Compound equipment.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the most critical file in this trajectory. It contains the hardcoded workout databases for both the Compound and Glutes muscle groups and is responsible for rendering all the workout cards and the progress bar.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent extensive modifications. A large new data structure for the Glutes workouts was added. The entire Glutes database was later overwritten multiple times with user-provided updates to Intensity Reasoning and Workout Summary text. The rendering logic was updated to display headers for each muscle group. Crucially, the code for the progress bar was refactored to limit its size to two rows and group equipment icons. Finally, multiple minor text formatting fixes were applied to the data (e.g., removing bold markdown from Trap Bar workouts and reformatting drop-set battle plans) to resolve UI spacing and layout inconsistencies.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the workout databases for the remaining individual muscle groups: Hammies, Quads, and Calves.
- Integrate these new muscle groups into the unified workout display screen, ensuring they appear alongside Compound and Glutes workouts when selected.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on resolving a set of specific UI and data-related issues reported by the user. All changes were made within the  file.

The key fixes implemented were:
1.  **Trap Bar Workout Card Height:** The extra vertical spacing on the Trap Bar workout cards was fixed. The issue was traced to long, unformatted description text and improper use of bold markdown in the Battle Plan. The descriptions were reformatted and the bolding was removed to ensure the card height matches all other workout cards.
2.  **Glutes Battle Plan Formatting:** The Battle Plan for Glutes workouts featuring drop sets was corrected. The instructions (e.g., Drop 20% → 10 reps) are now properly formatted as bullet points.
3.  **Progress Bar Logic:** The progress bar at the top of the screen was re-engineered to prevent it from overflowing. It is now capped at a maximum of two rows. If a user's selections exceed this limit, the individual equipment icons are grouped under their parent muscle group icon.
4.  **Content Update:** A final, specific text update was made to the Intensity Reasoning for the Wide Stance Trap Bar Squat workout as requested.

The frontend server was restarted after these changes were applied.
