  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has added/updated dozens of workouts and images in  and . A UI bug was fixed in  to show the Pull-Up Bar. A UI label was changed in .
     - Next debug checklist: Ask the user to comprehensively review the Abs and Back sections in the app. Specifically, they should check:
        1. All newly updated images in the Abs section are correct.
        2. The Pull-Up Bar button now appears in the Abs section and all its workouts/images are correct.
        3. The Back section now shows a Dumbbells button instead of Adjustable bench.
        4. All newly added workouts and images for all 10 updated Back equipment types are present and correct.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will close out another massive content update task and confirm the UI fixes were successful.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (manual user testing)
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 2:
     - Attempted fixes: The agent initially missed the user's request to add workouts to the Grip Variation Pull Up Bar and only added them to the Straight Pull Up Bar. After being prompted by the user twice, the agent correctly added the workouts.
     - Next debug checklist: As part of the main verification (Issue 1), pay special attention to the Grip Variation Pull Up Bar section and confirm with the user that it now correctly contains 4 workouts per level as requested.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This resolves an oversight by the previous agent and ensures the user's request is fully met.
     - Status:  RESOLVED (but requires user verification)
     - Is recurring issue? Y (Agent has a tendency to miss details in large content requests).
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (manual user testing)
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:
     - Attempted fixes: None. These are critical, long-standing issues carried over from previous sessions and were not addressed for the third consecutive session.
     - Next debug checklist: Refer to the initial handover summary ( of the LLM history) for detailed debugging steps for each issue.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? Fixing these will address significant technical debt, improve core app functionality, enhance UI/UX, and restore broken admin features.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Varies by issue (see initial summary).
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Verify All Content Updates**: Get explicit confirmation from the user that all Abs and Back updates are correct and displaying as expected.
- **(P1) Address High-Priority Technical Debt**: After user confirmation, you MUST proactively present the list of pending critical issues (Video player positioning, Profile fetch error, Broken search sheet, Broken admin widget) and ask the user to prioritize which one to tackle next. Three sessions have been spent entirely on content; it is critical to pivot back to fixing these bugs.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Abs Content/Image Updates**:
  - Updated images for workouts in: Ab Crunch Machine, Captain's Chair, Ab Wheel, Medicine Ball, Roman Chair, Decline Bench, and Pull-Up Bar.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1**: The agent initially missed the request to add workouts for the Grip Variation Pull Up Bar and had to be prompted twice by the user before implementing it. This indicates a failure to carefully parse large user requests.
- **Issue 2-5**: The critical bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget, 429 errors) listed in the initial handover summary were ignored for a third straight session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - All P2-P6 issues listed in the All Pending/In progress Issue list section were present in the initial handover summary and remain unfixed.
  - Recurrence count: 10+
  - Status: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Static Content Management**: All work involved editing large TypeScript data array files (, ). No backend or database interaction occurred.
- **Fragile UI Dependencies**: The agent fixed a bug () caused by the UI having a hardcoded list of equipment names that was not in sync with the data file. It then replicated this pattern by changing another hardcoded label in .

**key DB schema**
- No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Updated with new image URLs for various abs workouts.
- : Heavily updated with dozens of new workouts and image URLs for the back section.
- : Modified to add Pull-Up Bar to the list of equipment buttons.
- : Modified to rename the Adjustable bench button to Dumbbells.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The equipment lists in  and  are hardcoded and not dynamically generated from the data files (, ). This is brittle and has already caused a bug this session. These components should be refactored to derive their equipment lists directly from the data source to prevent future synchronization issues.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were used or modified.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **START HERE**: Your first task is to get confirmation from the user that all the extensive Abs and Back updates are correct. This is a massive amount of content, so be specific. Ask them to check the new workouts and images for all mentioned equipment categories in both sections.
2.  **PIVOT TO BUG FIXES (CRITICAL)**: For three consecutive sessions, the agent has focused solely on content updates while major pre-existing bugs have been ignored. Once the user confirms the content is correct, you **must** pivot the conversation to addressing this technical debt. Present the list of high-priority bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget) and ask the user which one you should fix next. Do not wait for the user to bring them up.
3.  **READ CAREFULLY**: The previous agent missed a user request to add workouts to the Grip Variation Pull-Up Bar and had to be reminded twice. Pay close attention to the details of user requests, especially when they involve large amounts of content.

**documents created in this job**
- None.

- No integrations were added or modified in this session.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None
  - Known regressions: None from this session's work, but major pre-existing bugs remain unaddressed.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- Continue as a guest or log in, then navigate to the Abs and Back workout sections to view the extensive content and image updates.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- For the third consecutive session, the agent completely ignored the critical, pre-existing bugs that were explicitly listed in the initial handover summary.
- The agent initially failed to add the Grip Variation Pull Up Bar workouts as requested, requiring the user to follow up twice. This demonstrates a lack of attention to detail when parsing large requests.
