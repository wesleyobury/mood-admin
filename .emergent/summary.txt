The trajectory documents a systematic and repetitive task of updating hardcoded workout data in a React Native application, driven entirely by the user's requests. Following the pattern established in a previous session for the cardio section, this work focused on the sweat weights path. The user provided two images for each of the nine equipment types in this section (Barbells, Battle Ropes, Dumbbells, etc.).

The AI engineer's workflow was consistent for each equipment type:
1.  Identify the central data source, which was found to be .
2.  Locate the specific equipment's data block within the file.
3.  Perform six separate file edits to insert the two image URLs into the  property for the two workouts across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
4.  Restart the Expo server to apply the changes.
5.  Confirm completion with the user and await the next set of images.

This process was methodically repeated until all nine equipment types in the light weights section were updated, at which point the AI engineer confirmed the completion of the entire section. The user's primary language is English, and future interactions should continue in English.

The user's objective is to visually enhance the application by adding images to workout cards. This task is a continuation of previous work, now focusing on the Sweat Weights section.

The core requirement is to populate workout cards with relevant imagery for all nine equipment types within this section: Barbells, Battle Ropes, Dumbbells, Flipping Tire, Kettlebells, Medicine Balls, Slam Balls, Sled, and Sledgehammer + Tire.

For each equipment type, the user provides two distinct images. The implementation pattern requires assigning the first image to the first workout card and the second image to the second workout card, consistently across all three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced). This results in updating six  properties per equipment type. The overall goal is to complete this for all nine equipment types, thereby fully populating the Light Weights section with images and improving user engagement.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data Source**: Application content, specifically all workout data for the light weights section, is managed within a large, hardcoded array in a TypeScript file.
- **Repetitive Code Modification**: Development consists of performing systematic search-and-replace style edits on a single data file () to update  properties.
- **Expo Development Workflow**: The standard cycle involves editing source code, restarting the Metro bundler (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started), and then confirming completion with the user.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application's Light Weights section content is driven by a centralized, hardcoded data structure, separate from the UI components that render it.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the most critical file for the tasks performed. It contains the  constant, a large array of objects that serves as the single source of truth for all equipment and workout details (names, descriptions, s, etc.) in the Light Weights section.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was the sole target of all code modifications. For each of the 9 equipment types (Barbells, Battle Ropes, etc.), six  properties were populated with URLs provided by the user. In total, 54  fields were added to this file across the entire session.
    

- ****
  - **Importance**: This screen component is responsible for rendering the list of workouts for a specific piece of equipment selected from the previous screen. It imports and consumes the data from .
  - **Summary of Changes**: No changes were made to this file.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This screen likely displays the selectable grid of all nine Light Weights equipment types, allowing the user to navigate to the workout list for each one.
  - **Summary of Changes**: No changes were made to this file.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding tasks. All user requests to add images for the nine equipment types in the Light Weights section have been successfully completed. The system is awaiting the user's next directive.

<current_work>
The work concluded upon successfully updating the images for the final equipment type in the Light Weights section: Sledgehammer + Tire.

1.  **User Request**: The user provided two images and asked to use these for sledgehammer and tire.
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI engineer located the  object within the  array. It then performed six distinct edits to add the two provided image URLs to the  property of the two workouts listed under the , , and  intensity levels.
4.  **Final Action**: After all six s were updated, the Expo server was restarted with expo: stopped
expo: started to apply the changes. The AI then sent a final summary message to the user, confirming that all nine equipment types in the Light Weights section were complete.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user that the Light Weights section updates are complete and ask for the next task or section they would like to work on.
