The previous AI engineer initiated by resolving a critical issue: the I want to sweat > Weight Based path was misdirecting to Build Explosiveness content. This was fixed by renaming Weight Based to Light weights in , updating  with correct equipment data, and creating a dedicated  file for comprehensive Light weights workout data. UI/UX parity was ensured by incorporating gradients, padding, and swipe indicators based on .

Subsequently, the user shifted focus to the Calisthenics path. The AI engineer duplicated the  screen to create  with specified equipment. Navigation was integrated via , and a placeholder  was initially created. Extensive calisthenics workout data was provided by the user, leading to a complete overhaul of  to mirror  design, including swipe functionality and data integration through . Multiple testing phases confirmed functionality and UI consistency. The trajectory concluded with the user reporting specific UI/UX discrepancies on the calisthenics workout cards, which the AI engineer was preparing to address.

The primary goal is to provide a polished, native-feeling workout application.
1.  **Light weights Path Fix**: Resolve an issue where I want to sweat > Weight Based incorrectly displayed Build Explosiveness content. This involved renaming Weight Based to Light weights and implementing correct equipment (Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Barbells, Medicine Balls, Slam Balls, Battle Ropes, Sled, Sledgehammer + Tire, Flipping Tire) and workout data with Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulties. UI/UX consistency, including padding, gold gradients, and a Swipe to explore section, was crucial.
2.  **Calisthenics Path Implementation**: Create a new workout path for Calisthenics.
    *   **Equipment Screen**: Duplicate the  template, listing specific equipment alphabetically: Pure bodyweight, Pull up bar, Parallel bars / dip station, Gymnast rings, Pushup bars / parallettes, Ab wheel.
    *   **Workouts Screen**: Implement a comprehensive workout display screen based on the light weights screen design, ensuring all UI/UX elements (layout, spacing, swipe navigation, progress bar, styling, routing) align. This includes detailed workout data for each equipment type across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulties, with 4 bodyweight workouts per intensity level and 3 for all other equipment, all swipe-enabled.
    *   **UI/UX Refinement for Calisthenics**: Address missing gold neon around workout card edges, standardize duration font, center i icon in intensity reasoning, ensure consistent picture dimensions with padding, and make workout titles white on the cards.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the comprehensive implementation of the Calisthenics workout path. This involved:
1.  **Creating **: Duplicated from , customized with 6 specific calisthenics equipment types (Ab wheel, Gymnast rings, Parallel bars / dip station, Pull up bar, Pure bodyweight, Pushup bars / parallettes), ensuring alphabetical order, correct progress bar flow, and consistent UI.
2.  **Updating Navigation**: Modified  to enable navigation to the new calisthenics path.
3.  **Creating **: Populated with extensive, detailed workout plans for each calisthenics equipment type across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulties, including the specification of 4 bodyweight workouts and 3 for other equipment per intensity level.
4.  **Implementing **: This screen was completely refactored to replicate the design and functionality of . This included importing and integrating the new workout data, implementing swipe-enabled workout cards with navigation dots (Swipe to explore), gold gradients, equipment-specific content, and ensuring overall UI/UX consistency.
5.  **Verification**: Multiple tests were performed, navigating through the calisthenics path, selecting single and multiple equipment types, and confirming that workout cards, content, progress bar, and swipe functionality were working as expected, matching the  design.

The AI engineer's work concluded with the user reporting several outstanding UI/UX issues on the  screen, despite previous verification. These issues include missing gold neon borders, incorrect duration font, misaligned i icon, inconsistent picture dimensions with padding, and incorrect workout title color.
