The trajectory documents the development of the Triceps workout feature, mirroring the existing Biceps path. The process began with the user providing extensive workout data for eight different equipment types. The AI engineer's first task was to populate  with this data, copying the structure and styling from the biceps screen.

Immediately after implementation, the user identified a critical bug: several workout cards were missing. The engineer correctly diagnosed this as a mismatch between equipment names passed from the selection screen () and the keys used in the newly created workout database (e.g., 'Dumbbell' vs. 'Dumbbells'). A series of file edits were performed to align these names, successfully resolving the issue.

Following this fix, the user reported a UI spacing problem on the triceps cards. The engineer fixed this by aligning the  height and  padding with the values from the biceps screen. However, the user requested a further reduction in spacing. The final actions in the trajectory were a more aggressive set of style changes to reduce the card height and internal padding, followed by a server restart. The work concluded pending verification of this latest UI adjustment.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build out the Triceps workout path within the fitness application, ensuring it is functionally and visually identical to the completed Biceps path.

Core requirements involve:
1.  **Populate Triceps Workout Data**: Implement the  screen with comprehensive, multi-level workout plans for eight specific pieces of equipment: Dumbbells, Kettlebells, EZ Bar, Cable Machine, Cable Crossover, Triceps Pushdown Machine, Dip Station, and TRX Bands. All descriptive content was provided by the user.
2.  **Ensure Visual and Functional Parity**: The triceps workout cards and guidance screen must perfectly replicate the layout, styling, and format of the biceps path. This includes resolving any discrepancies that arise during development.
3.  **Fix Data Mismatches**: Correctly link the equipment selection screen () with the workout display screen by ensuring equipment names match exactly, preventing issues like missing workout cards.
4.  **Refine UI Spacing**: Address specific user feedback regarding excessive vertical spacing on the workout cards, adjusting styles until the layout matches the compact design of the biceps cards.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Native & Expo**: The core framework for building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Expo Router**: Manages navigation through a file-based routing system in the  directory.
- **StyleSheet API**: All component styling is handled using , which was critical for the iterative UI spacing adjustments.
- **Data-in-component**: Workout data is stored as a large, hardcoded JavaScript array () directly within the  component.
- **Data Consistency**: Debugging revealed the necessity of maintaining exact string matches for equipment names between routing parameters and data structures.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses Expo Router, with screens defined as files in . The development focused on creating and refining the triceps workout display screen to match existing patterns.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the central file for the triceps feature. It receives an equipment name as a parameter and displays the corresponding detailed workout cards.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        1.  **Data Population**: The file was massively updated to include the , an array containing detailed workout plans for all 8 equipment types provided by the user.
        2.  **Data Key Correction**: The  key for every entry in the database was modified in a series of edits to match the exact strings passed from  (e.g., 'Dumbbells' was changed to 'Dumbbell', 'Cable Machine' to 'Single extension cable'). This fixed the missing cards bug.
        3.  **Icon Mapping Update**: The  function was updated to use the corrected equipment names.
        4.  **Initial Spacing Fix**: The  style's  was changed from  to , and the  style's  was changed from  to  to match the biceps screen.
        5.  **Final Spacing Fix (Current Work)**: The  height was further reduced from  to , and the 's  was reduced from  to  to make the layout more compact.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This screen allows the user to select a piece of triceps equipment. It was crucial for debugging, as the equipment names defined here are the source of truth that the display screen must match.
    -   **Summary of changes**: This file was read to diagnose the missing cards issue but was not modified.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file served as the blueprint for the triceps screen. Its styling rules were the target for achieving visual consistency.
    -   **Summary of changes**: This file was read to compare styling values for the spacing fixes but was not modified.

<pending_tasks>
- Verify if the most recent, more aggressive spacing adjustments on the triceps workout cards have resolved the UI issue to the user's satisfaction.
- Conduct end-to-end testing of the newly populated Triceps user flow to ensure navigation and data display work correctly for all 8 equipment types.

<current_work>
The most recent task was a direct response to user feedback that the triceps workout cards still had too much vertical space, even after being styled to match the biceps cards initially. The engineer was in the process of implementing a more aggressive fix to create a more compact layout.

The final actions involved editing the  in  in two specific ways:

1.  The height of the  style was further reduced from  to .
    
2.  The vertical padding of the  style was reduced from  to .
    
The work concluded immediately after restarting the frontend server to apply these changes. The effectiveness of this final adjustment has not yet been verified by the user.

<optional_next_step>
Check the UI to confirm if the latest height and padding reductions have successfully resolved the spacing issue on the  screen.
