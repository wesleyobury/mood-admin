The previous AI engineer’s work began by addressing existing product requirements: fixing the squared neon glow edges on workout cards and achieving an edge-to-edge background across all screens. Initial efforts successfully adjusted shadow properties and replaced  with standard  components, managing safe area insets manually. Landing page spacing was also iteratively refined.

A major new feature, a workout shopping cart, was subsequently introduced. The AI engineer implemented ,  component, and dedicated  and  screens. The 1/2 workout indicator was replaced with an animated Add workout + button. Throughout implementation, the AI debugged Python script errors and TypeScript issues.

User feedback led to UI refinements, including button color changes, a darker remove button in the cart, and the display of mood card titles within cart items. Critical navigation bugs emerged where Start Workout buttons stopped linking to . The AI then focused on fixing these links, adapting  for multi-workout sessions, and correcting parameter passing (, ) in various  files. The final action involved correcting  usage in 's  function.

The core product goal is a polished, native-feeling workout application. Initial features included Light weights, Calisthenics, and Outdoor paths. Previous bug fixes addressed Build explosiveness text shortening, Weight Based Cardio text and duplicate bodyweight icons, lightening home screen mood card neon glow, and rounding squared neon glow edges on lazy workout cards. Immediately before this work, the focus was on achieving an edge-to-edge background on all screens and refining landing page spacing.

The most recent feature added is a Workout Shopping Cart. Users can add workouts from the I want to sweat > cardio based path to a cart for back-to-back completion. The 1/2 indicator on workout cards is replaced with an animated Add workout + button, which changes to a checkmark upon click. Cart content is stored in local state and accessed via a floating cart icon. The cart screen allows starting workout sessions and removing items. Design specifics include a scale bounce transition for the button, initial button color of dark grey, checkmark color of gold, and a darker, transparent red for the cart's remove X button. Each workout card in the cart should display the abbreviated mood card title. A critical requirement has been to ensure all Start Workout buttons, both on individual workout cards and within the workout cart, correctly link to the original  screens, which now support multi-workout sessions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a bug reported by the user: the Start Workout buttons within the cardio-based path were still broken, despite previous fixes for other workout display screens. The user specified these buttons should lead to their original workout guidance screens, mirroring the Start Workout Session button from the cart.

The AI investigated , specifically the  function. It was discovered that  was attempting to use a  parameter that was not defined in its scope, leading to incorrect navigation.

To fix this, the AI made the following change:
- In , the  function was modified to use the  parameter (which is available from the  hook) as the  value when navigating to . This aligns the parameter passing with what  expects for context, ensuring the navigation links function correctly for individual workouts from the cardio path.

After this modification, the Expo server was restarted. The trajectory ends at this point, with the fix implemented and the server restarted, awaiting verification.
