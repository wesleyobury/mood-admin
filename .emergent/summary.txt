**original_problem_statement**:
The user requested to refactor two workout screen components that were nearly identical:  (Cardio path) and  (Light Weights path).

The tasks were:
1.  **Initial Cleanup:** Before refactoring, remove the swipe to explore text from the bottom of the workout cards in both files.
2.  **Component Consolidation:** Create a single, reusable  component to replace the duplicated logic and UI in the two files. This involved:
    *   Creating a shared types file ().
    *   Extracting the hardcoded workout data from  into its own file ().
    *   Rewriting both  and  to use the new shared component, passing in data via props.
3.  **New Feature/UI Iteration:** After the refactor, add new text back to the card.
    *   Add text that says Swipe for more.
    *   Position it as an overlay, 12px below the Add workout button.
    *   Iteratively style the text to be slightly gray, with a font size of 10px.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent successfully completed the entire refactoring process.
- A new reusable component exists at  which now renders the workout cards for both the Cardio and Light Weights paths.
- The  and  screen files have been significantly simplified to just import and use this new component.
- The hardcoded cardio workout data has been moved to .
- A shared types file, , has been created.
- The new Swipe for more text has been added to the  component and styled according to the user's latest request.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was applying the final styling changes to the Swipe for more text within the shared  component. The user requested the text be made slightly gray, have the 'S' capitalized, and the font size set to 10. The agent implemented this by changing the text in the JSX and updating the  style in the .
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent or screenshot tool to visually verify the final appearance of the Swipe for more text on the workout cards.
    - User Testing Done: N

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P0: User must create a new EAS Build.** (Carried over).
    - **P1: Verify Terms Versioning EULA flow.** (Carried over).
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **P0: Refactor other duplicated workout screens.** The pattern established by creating  should be applied to other similar screens (e.g., calisthenics, outdoor) to further reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
    - Refactor hardcoded Workout Data from any remaining  files.
    - Refactor  into smaller components.
    - Refactor .

**Completed work in this session**
- Removed the old swipe to explore text from  and .
- **Major Component Refactoring:**
  - Created a reusable component: .
  - Created a shared types file: .
  - Extracted hardcoded data into .
  - Updated  to use the new shared types.
  - Rewrote  and  to use the new  component, reducing their line counts from ~3800 to ~370 and ~900 to ~370, respectively.
- **Bug Fix:** Resolved a TypeScript error in the newly created  by adding a missing  property.
- **New UI Feature:** Added Swipe for more text to the  component.
- **UI Polish:** Iteratively updated the style (color, font size) and content (Swipe for more) of the new text based on user feedback.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - Issue 1: Home screen carousel Save button is not functional.
   - Issue 2: Unfollow analytics tracking is not working.
   - Issue 3: ESLint parsing errors for TypeScript  keyword.
   - Issue 4: Pre-existing TypeScript errors in various files.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - The ESLint parsing error and general TypeScript errors are recurring issues from previous sessions.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Component Refactoring:** The core of the session was abstracting duplicated JSX and logic into a single, reusable React component.
- **Data Externalization:** Moving hardcoded data from a component file () into a dedicated data file () to separate concerns.
- **Shared Typing:** Creating a central  file to enforce consistent data structures across the application.
- **Props-based-customization:** The new  component is designed to be configured via props, making it flexible for use in different contexts.

**key DB schema**
  - No database schema changes were made in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- **Created:**
    - : The new, reusable workout card component.
    - : Contains the shared , , etc., interfaces.
    - : Contains the workout data previously hardcoded in .
- **Updated/Refactored:**
    - : Drastically simplified to use .
    - : Drastically simplified to use .
    - : Modified to import types from the new  file.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The successful refactoring of the two workout screens has created a clear pattern. This pattern should now be applied to other workout screens (e.g., calisthenics, outdoor) that likely contain similar duplicated code.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were created or modified in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Verify Final UI Change:** The immediate next step is to confirm with the user that the final styling of the Swipe for more text (gray, 10px font) in  is correct.
2.  **Leverage the New Component:** You are now equipped with a reusable . If asked to make changes to workout cards, you should only need to edit this one file. Be aware of this to avoid re-introducing inconsistencies.
3.  **Refactoring Pattern:** The work done in this session serves as a blueprint for improving other parts of the app. When you see duplicated UI, propose a similar refactoring strategy: extract logic to a reusable component, externalize data, and create shared types.
