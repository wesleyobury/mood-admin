The AI engineer successfully implemented the Build Explosiveness feature's Weight Based path. Initially, this involved creating  and , replicating UI/UX from . After achieving exact UI/UX replication for , the user requested a unified Your Workouts screen for all selected weight-based equipment, mirroring the bodyweight path. The AI responded by creating , migrating data, and removing individual workout files. Subsequently, the AI addressed user feedback to correct the progress bar text to Build Explosive on equipment screens and is currently working on shortening intermediate to Intermed. in workout screen progress bars to prevent text truncation. The work shows a strong focus on precise UI/UX matching and responsive feature adaptation.

<product_requirements>
The application provides native-feeling workout guidance, with existing Legs and Abs paths. Key requirements for the AI engineer included:
1.  **Build Explosiveness Path Implementation**: This new path was to replace the I want a light sweat card on the home screen.
    *   **Workout Type Selection**: Offer Body weight and Weight based options.
    *   **Bodyweight Path**: Develop equipment selection (Battle Ropes, Plyo Box, Bodyweight Only, Med Ball, Sled, Kettlebell, Sandbag) and corresponding Your Workouts screens with 3 swipeable cards per intensity per equipment, replicating existing UI/UX.
    *   **Weight Based Path**: Create equipment selection (Power Lifting Platform, Landmine Attachment, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Chains / Bands, Trap Hex Bar). Implement Your Workouts for these, initially for Power Lifting Platform with 4 swipeable cards per intensity, then for others with 3 cards, exactly replicating design specifications (layout, spacing, format, padding, height, photos, fonts, gradients, button, swipe function).
    *   **Data Integration**: Incorporate comprehensive, hardcoded workout data.
    *   **Text Standardization**: Standardize mood card/header text to Build Explosive.
2.  **General UI/UX**: Ensure bidirectional swipe and clickable dots for all workout cards and standardize progress bars to a single-row icon-based format.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding text truncation in the progress bars of workout display screens. Specifically, the task is to shorten the word intermediate to Intermed. to prevent it from being cut off.

The AI engineer has already completed the first part of the recent user request (Chat Message 86) by fixing the progress bar text on the equipment screens ( and ) to consistently display Build Explosion.

The current focus is on the second part of the request:
1.  **Identify Truncation Point**: Pinpoint where the intermediate difficulty level text is displayed in the progress bar of workout screens.
2.  **Modify Text**: Change intermediate to Intermed. in  and .

The AI is currently inspecting  (Chat Message 94-95) to locate the relevant code for this modification.
