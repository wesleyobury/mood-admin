The trajectory documents a highly repetitive but systematic task of updating hardcoded data in a React Native application. The user-driven initiative was to add images to workout cards within the cardio section of the app. The AI engineer's workflow was consistent for each of the 12 equipment types: receive two image URLs from the user, locate the corresponding data object within the monolithic  file, and perform six individual file edits to update the  property for two workouts across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). This process was repeated for Arm Bike, Assault Bike, Treadmill, and others. Each set of edits was followed by a server restart and verification.

The core of the work involved manipulating a large, hardcoded JavaScript object, highlighting a data management pattern that might be brittle long-term but was effectively handled by the engineer's focused, repetitive execution. The final action in the trajectory was a more specific request to update just one of the two images for the Elliptical equipment, which the engineer also completed successfully before the session ended. The user's primary language is English, and future interactions should continue in English.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary goal was to visually enhance the cardio workout section of the fitness application by adding images to the workout cards.

The core requirements were:
1.  For each of the 12 specified cardio equipment types (e.g., Arm Bike, Assault Bike, Treadmill, etc.), the user provided two distinct images.
2.  The task was to associate these images with the workout cards. Specifically, for each equipment type, the first image should be used for the first workout card in the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced intensity levels. The second image should be used for the second workout card in each of those levels.
3.  This resulted in updating the  for 6 workout objects per equipment type.
4.  A final, one-off requirement was to replace the first image for the Elliptical with a new one provided by the user, affecting three specific workout cards.

The overall objective was to populate the UI with relevant imagery, moving away from placeholders and improving user engagement.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data Management**: Application content, specifically workout data including image URLs, is managed within a large, hardcoded JavaScript object inside a component file.
- **Repetitive Code Modification**: The development process consisted of performing numerous, systematic search-and-replace style edits on a single file () to update data.
- **Expo Development Workflow**: The standard cycle involved editing source code, restarting the Metro bundler (expo: stopped
expo: started), and verifying changes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's content for the cardio section is primarily driven by a large, hardcoded data structure within a single screen file.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the most critical file for the executed tasks. It contains a massive hardcoded data array named . This array holds objects for every piece of equipment, which in turn contain the workout details (name, description, , etc.) for all intensity levels. All workout card images are sourced from this file.
  - **Summary of Changes**: The  property was systematically updated for 75 workout objects within this file. For 12 different equipment types (Arm bike, Assault bike, Curve treadmill, Elliptical, Jump rope, Punching bag, Row machine, Ski machine, Stair master, Stationary bike, Treadmill, Vertical Climber), 6  fields were populated by alternating two user-provided images. Finally, 3 of the elliptical  fields were updated again with a new image.

    Example of the data structure for one equipment type:
    

- ****
  - **Importance**: This file likely renders the screen where the user selects their desired cardio equipment. The AI engineer initially inspected this file but found that the actual workout data was centralized in .
  - **Summary of Changes**: No changes were made to this file.

- Awaiting user feedback on the final set of changes, specifically the updated first image for the elliptical workouts. All explicit requests from the provided trajectory have been completed.

<current_work>
The most recent task was a specific image update for the Elliptical workouts. The user provided a single new image and requested to update the first pic for eliptical.

The AI engineer correctly interpreted this to mean replacing the image for the first workout card across all three intensity levels. The following actions were performed:

1.  **File Edited**: 
2.  **Changes Made**: The  property was updated with the new URL for the following three workouts:
    -   Beginner: 'Resistance Rounds'
    -   Intermediate: 'Climb & Sprint'
    -   Advanced: 'Tabata Elliptical'

3.  **Final Action**: The Expo server was restarted using expo: stopped
expo: started to apply the changes.

The work concluded immediately after the server restart. Verification of this final change has not yet been performed, and no confirmation has been sent to the user.

<optional_next_step>
I will verify the last change to the elliptical image was applied correctly and then confirm with the user that all requested cardio image updates are complete, asking for their review.
