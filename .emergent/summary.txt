The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's work, initially summarizing previous tasks on Legs and Abs workout paths, noting  achieved complete swipe functionality. The primary user request (Chat Message 5) was to extend this bidirectional swipe and clickable dot functionality to *all* workout cards, prioritizing muscle gainer then sweat paths. The AI meticulously analyzed relevant files, confirming  as the functional benchmark with  and programmatic scrolling. Subsequently, the engineer implemented -based swipe functionality across most  files. A notable deviation was , which retained its  while gaining clickable dots. Finally, a user request (Chat Message 173, 204) emerged to standardize progress bars across muscle gainer and i want to sweat paths to a single-row format, which the AI completed by modifying several files.

<product_requirements>
The initial project focused on completing the Legs workout path, followed by building the Abs workout path. Key requirements for Abs included: creating  with specific equipment and intensity selection; implementing comprehensive hardcoded workout data; exact UI/UX replication of the Chest path in ; reordering the progress bar to a single row (mood, body part, intensity, equipment count); implementing bidirectional swiping and clickable progress dots; and ensuring visual consistency like golden difficulty badges.

The most recent product requirements are:
1.  Extend the complete bidirectional swipe functionality with clickable dots (as implemented in ) to *all* other workout cards within the muscle gainer and i want to sweat paths, prioritizing muscle gainer first.
2.  Standardize the progress bars in muscle gainer paths (arms, back, chest, shoulders) and the i want to sweat path to a single-row format (mood card, muscle group, intensity level, # of equipment selected), mirroring the Abs path.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Progress Bar Standardization (Legs Path):** The  file's progress bar has not been updated to the new single-row, icon-based format (mood card, muscle group, intensity level, # of equipment selected) as implemented in other muscle gainer paths.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the two main user-requested tasks.
First, the complete bidirectional swipe functionality with clickable dots (as implemented in ) has been extended to *all* other workout cards. This involved updating , , , , , , , and  to use  with  for programmatic scrolling. For , clickable dots were added while preserving its existing  based swipe.
Second, the progress bars in , , , , , and  (for the I want to sweat path) have been standardized to a single-row format displaying mood, body part/workout type, intensity, and equipment count, consistent with . The  function and necessary styles were integrated where required. The frontend service was restarted after the final changes ().
