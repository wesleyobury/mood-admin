The previous AI engineer successfully implemented the Legs workout path, addressing equipment cross-contamination and consistent intensity display. Subsequently, the primary focus shifted to developing the Abs workout path. This involved creating new route files (, ), integrating them into the main navigation (), and populating  with extensive hardcoded workout data. Significant effort was dedicated to replicating the UI/UX of the Chest path, including precise styling for workout cards, implementing swipeable functionality, and meticulously matching colors for intensity and difficulty badges. The engineer also introduced bidirectional swiping and clickable progress dots. Throughout the process, automated screenshot tests repeatedly failed to navigate correctly to the workout display, consistently landing on the main page, though the engineer confirmed code-level changes.

The initial overarching goal was to complete the Legs workout path, which required adding Hamstrings, Quads, and Calves muscle groups, integrating their hardcoded workout data, and refining UI elements such as the progress bar to show only selected muscle groups. Key bug fixes included ensuring correct  parameters were passed, consistently displaying intensity level selection for Legs workouts in a format similar to the Chest path, and preventing equipment selection cross-contamination across muscle groups.

The subsequent and primary product requirement focused on building the Abs workout path, which involved:
1.  **Abs Equipment Screen:** Create an equipment selection screen () for Abs workouts where options are vertically stacked and alphabetically ordered, with an intensity level selection section identical to the Chest path. The equipment list was specifically defined to include Ab Roller, Cable Machine, Captain’s Chair, Roman Hyperextension, Medicine Ball, Stability Ball, Dumbbells, and Decline Bench, with later modifications to swap Cable Machine for Ab Crunch Machine, remove Dumbbells and Stability Ball, and add Body Weight.
2.  **Comprehensive Abs Workouts:** Implement a detailed set of hardcoded workout data for various Abs equipment, covering Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulty levels.
3.  **UI/UX Duplication (Chest Path for Abs):** Duplicate the Your Workouts display screen () from the Chest path, ensuring an exact match across all visual specifications: workout card layout, progress bar format, swipeable workouts for the same equipment type, picture dimensions, content placement, formatting, colors (golden for intensity/difficulty), gradients, borders, and padding.
4.  **Progress Bar Enhancements:** The Abs progress bar should clearly layout the selected equipment with individual icons in a single row, showing mood card, body part, intensity level, and the number of equipment selected.
5.  **Interactive Navigation:** Implement bidirectional swiping on workout cards (allowing users to swipe back) and make the small progress circles (dots) in the swipe to explore section clickable to achieve the same swipe functionality.
6.  **Visual Consistency Fixes:**
    *   The intensity level icon background on workout cards needed to be golden, matching the Chest path, and the text below should say Swipe to explore allowing a swipe for the 2nd workout of that equipment type, with the top-right icon showing 1/2 or 2/2 instead of 2 workouts.
    *   A specific bug causing the intensity reason text background on intermediate and advanced workout cards to appear green instead of golden had to be diagnosed and resolved, ensuring it matched the uniform golden aesthetic of other paths.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file serves as the main entry point for users to select a body part (e.g., Legs, Abs) and navigate to the respective equipment selection screen.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Modified to include a navigation link for the Abs workout path, directing users to the newly created  screen.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This screen allows users to select specific equipment for their Abs workout and configure intensity levels before proceeding to the workout display.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**
        -   Newly created to manage Abs specific equipment selection and pass parameters to the workout display.
        -   Implemented equipment options (e.g., Ab Roller, Captain's Chair) displayed vertically and alphabetically.
        -   Integrated an intensity level selection UI matching the design seen in .
        -   The equipment list was dynamically updated multiple times; for instance, Cable Machine was replaced with Ab Crunch Machine, Dumbbells and Stability Ball were removed, and Body Weight was added as an option.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the core screen for displaying the generated Abs workouts. It renders workout cards, a progress bar, and manages the swipeable interface for workouts.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**
        -   Initially a basic placeholder, it was subsequently completely refactored to precisely mirror the complex UI/UX and functionality of .
        -   Populated with comprehensive, hardcoded workout data for all specified Abs equipment and difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
        -   Implemented the workout card structure including dynamic text like Swipe to explore at the bottom and numerical indicators (e.g., 1/2) in the top right.
        -   Fixed styling issues: The intensity level background was set to a translucent golden () with dark text/icons. The persistent green background on the Intensity Reasoning text for intermediate/advanced cards was resolved by applying a uniform golden color () to all difficulty badges, consistent with the .
        -   The progress bar layout was reordered to a single row displaying mood, body part, intensity, and selected equipment count, each with individual icons.
        -   Implemented bidirectional swiping for workout cards and made the pagination dots (small circles below Swipe to explore) clickable, using a  to programmatically scroll the .

<current_work>
The most recent work involved a comprehensive overhaul of the Abs workout display, focusing on achieving pixel-perfect UI/UX parity with the existing Chest workout path, and enhancing interactive elements.

Specifically, the  file was extensively modified to:
1.  **Uniform Golden Difficulty Badges:** Resolved an issue where Intermediate and Advanced workout cards displayed a green background for the intensity reason text. This was diagnosed as incorrect  usage; the fix involved setting all difficulty badges to a uniform golden color (), matching the  standard.
2.  **Enhanced Progress Bar Layout:** The progress bar at the top was reordered to a single row that now prominently displays the Mood Card, Body Part, Intensity Level, and the Number of Equipment Selected. This includes individual icons for each selected equipment type, enhancing clarity and user confidence in their selections.
3.  **Bidirectional Swiping:** Implemented functionality to allow users to swipe workout cards both right and left, ensuring a fluid and intuitive navigation experience within an equipment type's workouts.
4.  **Clickable Progress Dots:** The small circular indicators (pagination dots) beneath the Swipe to explore section were made interactive. Users can now tap these dots to directly navigate to specific workout cards within a given equipment type. This involved leveraging  to programmatically scroll the  component, synchronizing the visual indicators with the workout cards.

Following these implementations, the frontend was restarted and automated screenshot tests were attempted. However, the automated testing environment consistently failed to navigate to the  screen, instead returning to the landing page with Get Started. Despite this testing hurdle, the code changes for all requested features (golden difficulty badges, single-row progress bar, bidirectional swiping, and clickable dots) were successfully implemented at the code level.
