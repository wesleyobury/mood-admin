The trajectory details a systematic, user-driven process of populating workout image URLs for the Chest section of a React Native application. This follows a clear, established pattern where the user provides an equipment name and two image files. The AI engineer then locates the corresponding data structure and updates it.

The entire process is centered on modifying a single file: . This file contains a large, hardcoded data object named . The AI engineer successfully updated all nine equipment types in the chest section: Cable crossover, Adjustable bench, Chest press machine, Decline bench, Flat bench, Dip station, Incline bench, Pec dec machine, and Smith machine.

For each equipment type, the AI engineer executed six  operations to insert the two user-provided image URLs into the  fields across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). After completing each equipment type, the AI restarted the Expo server and provided a detailed progress report. The trajectory concludes after the Smith machine is finished, marking the completion of the entire Chest section. The AI is now awaiting user feedback and direction for the next task.

The user's language is English, and all future interactions should be conducted in English.

The primary goal is to visually enhance the application's workout screens by adding relevant, user-provided images to each workout. The development is proceeding muscle group by muscle group.

The focus of this trajectory was the Chest workout section. The established workflow involves the user providing an equipment name (e.g., Flat bench) and two corresponding image files. The engineer's task is to integrate these images by updating a hardcoded data object located in the specific component file for that muscle group.

For each of the nine equipment types in the chest section, six workouts (two each for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels) had their placeholder  properties populated with the new image URLs. This iterative process was repeated until all equipment in the  file was updated, successfully completing the requirements for the entire Chest section.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data:** Workout data is not fetched from an API but is stored as a large constant object directly within its corresponding React Native component file.
- **Repetitive File Editing:** The core workflow involves a repeated cycle of locating and replacing  strings within the hardcoded data structure using file editing commands.
- **Component-Scoped Data:** Each muscle group has a dedicated  file containing both its UI logic and all associated data.
- **Expo Development Cycle:** The standard procedure is edit code, restart the Metro bundler (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: ERROR (abnormal termination)), and report progress.

<code_architecture>
The application's content is structured by muscle group, with each section having a dedicated component file that contains both its UI logic and its hardcoded data.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the single source of truth for the Chest workout feature. It contains the React component for rendering the UI and the entire data source for all chest workouts, stored in a large constant named . This tight coupling of data and presentation is the established architectural pattern for workout content in the app.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: This file was the exclusive target of all modifications in the trajectory. For all nine equipment types in the Chest section, the AI engineer performed six  operations each, for a total of 54 edits. Each edit replaced a placeholder  with a user-provided image URL. The edits were distributed across the , , and  workout arrays for each equipment type. The entire Chest section in this file is now fully populated with images.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicit pending tasks. The Chest section update, which was the focus of the trajectory, has been fully completed (9 out of 9 equipment types updated). The next action is dependent on the user's direction.

<current_work>
The most recent work was the completion of the entire Chest workout section. The final task involved updating the images for the Smith machine, the last of nine equipment types.

1.  **User Input**: The user provided two images for the Smith machine.
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI located the  data object within the  constant. It then executed six  commands to insert the two provided image URLs into the  properties for the beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts.
4.  **Final Action**: After the edits, the Expo server was restarted (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started). A final summary was sent to the user, confirming the completion of the Smith machine and, consequently, the entire Chest section. The AI is now awaiting the user's review and instructions on what to do next, whether it's moving to a new muscle group or addressing potential issues.

<optional_next_step>
Wait for the user to review the completed Chest section and provide direction for the next task (e.g., start a new muscle group, make adjustments).
