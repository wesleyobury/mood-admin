The previous AI engineer's work, which was passed to me, initially focused on MOOD app UI/UX, data consistency, and implementing the  field for detailed workout instructions across Chest, Shoulders, and Cardio sections. Visual consistency issues like  shading and cardio gradient backgrounds were also addressed. The current trajectory began with the user explicitly requesting to condense all intensity level descriptions in the cardio path to a maximum of two lines, as demonstrated by a screenshot.

The AI engineer systematically addressed this by iteratively searching for and editing long  strings within . The process involved identifying descriptions over 70 characters and manually shortening them, performing numerous  operations in batches. During this, attempts to take screenshots for verification exposed frontend navigation issues (incorrect port, Unicode errors in script, general navigation failures), but the agent correctly prioritized the core user request. After successfully reducing all long intensity reasons, the user reported a missing  for the HIIT Ski workout. This was added and subsequently modified to match precise user-provided text, including a final minor edit to remove a period. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer confirming the full resolution of both the intensity description condensation and the HIIT Ski battle plan issue.

Explicit requirements included:
1.  **Equipment/Workout Screens:** Implement  and  with alphabetized equipment and content.
2.  **UI/UX Standardization:** Duplicate Chest UI/UX (swipeable cards, non-scrollable progress bar, start button) for Shoulders.
3.  **Content Formatting:** Workout cards to display *exactly 3-line summaries* (), while detailed s are for guidance screens.
4.  **Equipment Naming Consistency:** Standardize Pec Dec Rear Delt Fly to Rear Delt Fly Machine, then revert Pec dec machine for chest.
5.  **Chest Path Specifics:** Apply 3-line summaries, standardize card dimensions, shorten  to max 3 lines, update progress bar (4 icons/row, smaller elements), add neon shading to cards.
6.  **Workout Card Title Standardization:** All workout card titles (chest and shoulders) to be *1 line*.
7.  **Chest Card Visuals:** Photos with rounded edges, duration & intensity on same line; content width matches photo; intensity icon text black, i icon yellow.
8.  **Chest Text Alignment:** Workout title, duration, 3-line description moved slightly left (6px padding).
9.  **Shoulder Card Visuals:** Apply chest/cardio layout updates: neon glow, matching picture dimensions, correct padding.
10. **Shoulder Workout Display Bug:** Ensure all equipment has correctly linked workouts.
11. **Cardio Path Enhancements:** Add light neon gold shading to bottom of workout cards; condense all cardio workout  to 3-line summaries; restore full s on guidance screens; duration and intensity on same line; intensity level text black; restore light neon gold gradient around .
**New Request (during trajectory):** Condense *all* cardio intensity level descriptions to a *maximum of two lines* on workout cards.
**New Request (during trajectory):** Ensure HIIT Ski workout in cardio path has full  content, specifically: 8 roundsn20 sec max effortn10 sec restnRest for two minutesnRepeat for 2 cycles. Subsequently, remove the period from Repeat for 2 cycles.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of tasks related to the Sweat (cardio-based) path, as per user requests.

The primary task involved condensing all intensity level descriptions within the cardio workout cards in  to a maximum of two lines. This was a substantial effort, as there were originally 132 descriptions identified as being over 70 characters long (and thus likely rendering over two lines). The AI engineer systematically located and iteratively edited these descriptions through numerous  operations, ensuring brevity while retaining technical accuracy. This iterative process was tracked and reported in summaries, eventually leading to the successful condensation of all problematic descriptions.

Following this, the user identified a new issue: the Advanced Ski Machine workout, specifically HIIT Ski, was missing its full  content on the workout guidance screen. The AI engineer located the HIIT Ski workout in  and added the specified detailed : • 8 roundsn• 20 sec max effortn• 10 sec restn• Rest for two minutesn• Repeat for 2 cycles. A subsequent user request involved a minor textual correction, removing the period from Repeat for 2 cycles. Both the addition and the final textual refinement of the HIIT Ski  were successfully implemented and verified.
