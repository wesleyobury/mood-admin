The trajectory details a systematic, user-driven process of populating workout image URLs for the Shoulders section of a React Native application. The process follows a clear, established pattern where the user provides an equipment name and two image files. The AI engineer then locates the corresponding data structure within a specific file and updates the  fields.

The entire process is centered on modifying a single file: . This file contains a large, hardcoded data object that holds all workout information for the shoulders. The AI engineer successfully updated all ten equipment types for this section: Adjustable bench, Dumbbells, Barbells, Cable Crossover Machine, Kettlebells, Landmine Attachment, Rear Delt Fly Machine, Powerlifting Platform, Shoulder Press Machine, and Smith Machine.

For each equipment type, the AI engineer executed six  operations to insert the two user-provided image URLs into the  fields across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). After completing each equipment type, the AI restarted the Expo server and provided a detailed progress report. The trajectory concludes after the Smith Machine is finished, marking the completion of the entire Shoulders section. The AI is now awaiting user feedback and direction for the next task.

The user's language is English, and all future interactions should be conducted in English.

The primary goal is to visually enhance the application's workout screens by adding relevant, user-provided images to each workout exercise. The development is proceeding iteratively, focusing on one muscle group at a time.

The work detailed in this trajectory was to populate the Shoulders workout section. The established workflow requires the user to provide an equipment name (e.g., Barbells) and two corresponding image files. The engineer's task is to integrate these images by updating a hardcoded data object located in the specific component file for that muscle group ().

This process was repeated for all ten equipment types in the shoulders section. For each equipment type, six workouts (two each for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels) had their placeholder  properties populated with the new image URLs. The task was successfully completed, and the app's Shoulders section is now fully populated with images.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data:** Workout information is not fetched from an API but is stored as a large constant object directly within its corresponding React Native component file.
- **Component-Scoped Data:** Each muscle group has a dedicated  file that contains both its UI logic and all associated data.
- **Repetitive File Editing:** The core workflow involves a repeated cycle of locating and replacing  strings within the data structure.
- **Expo Development Cycle:** The standard procedure is to edit code, restart the Metro bundler (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started), and report progress.

<code_architecture>
The application's content is structured by muscle group, with each section having a dedicated component file that contains both its UI logic and its hardcoded data.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This file is the single source of truth for the Shoulders workout feature. It contains the React component for rendering the UI and the entire data source for all shoulder workouts, stored in a large constant array (likely named ). This tight coupling of data and presentation is the established architectural pattern for workout content in the app.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: This file was the exclusive target of all modifications in the trajectory. For all ten equipment types in the Shoulders section, the AI engineer performed six  operations each, for a total of 60 edits. Each edit replaced a placeholder  with a user-provided image URL. The edits were distributed across the , , and  workout arrays for each equipment type. The entire Shoulders section in this file is now fully populated with images.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicit pending tasks. The Shoulders section update, which was the focus of the trajectory, has been fully completed (10 out of 10 equipment types updated). The next action is dependent on the user's direction.

<current_work>
The most recent work was the completion of the entire Shoulders workout section. The final task involved updating the images for the Smith Machine, the last of ten equipment types for this section.

1.  **User Input**: The user provided the instruction now use these for smith machine along with two image files.
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI located the  data object within the file's hardcoded database. It then executed six  commands to insert the two provided image URLs ( and ) into the  properties for the beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts.
4.  **Final Action**: After the edits, the Expo server was restarted (expo: stopped
expo: started). A final summary was sent to the user, confirming the completion of the Smith Machine and, consequently, the entire Shoulders section. The AI is now awaiting the user's review and instructions on what to do next.

<optional_next_step>
Await user instructions for the next muscle group to work on. If none are provided, ask the user which section to update next to continue enhancing the application.
