The trajectory details a systematic and repetitive workflow for populating a React Native fitness application with workout images. The user directs the process by specifying a workout category and equipment type, then provides the corresponding image assets. The AI engineer's task is to update the hardcoded data structures within the application's source code.

Initially, the AI attempted to find the Build Explosion section in the previously known monolithic file, . After failing to find the section, the AI intelligently discovered a new, relevant file, , by listing the directory contents. This marked a key architectural discovery, revealing that workout data is segmented into multiple large, category-specific files rather than a single global one.

Following this discovery, the AI methodically populated images for every equipment type within the Build Explosion path, as directed by the user. This included Battle Ropes, Body Weight Only, Kettle Bell, Med Ball, Plyo Box, Sand Bag, and Sled workouts. The consistent workflow involved: receiving assets, locating the data block in the correct file, executing numerous  commands, restarting the Expo server, and providing a detailed progress summary to the user. The trajectory concludes immediately after the AI finishes updating the final Sled section and restarts the server, just before sending the concluding summary.

The user's language is English. Future interactions should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The project's objective is to visually enhance a fitness application by adding images to all workout exercises. The development process is highly iterative and user-driven, where the user acts as a product owner, providing specific instructions and image assets for different workout categories.

The core task involves the engineer editing hardcoded workout databases within the frontend codebase. For each specified equipment type (e.g., Battle Ropes, Kettle Bell), the engineer must insert the provided image URLs into the  field for every workout variation (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

So far, the Legs Day workouts (Compound, Glutes, Hamstrings, etc.) were completed in a previous session. The work detailed in this trajectory focuses entirely on the Build Explosion workout path. This involved identifying a new data file and systematically populating images for all its equipment categories: Battle Ropes, Body Weight Only, Kettle Bell, Med Ball, Plyo Box, Sand Bag, and Sled. The goal is to create a more engaging and intuitive user experience by providing clear visual guidance for each exercise.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data**: Workout data, including exercises and image URLs, is stored in TypeScript constant arrays directly within component files.
- **Component-Scoped Data Monoliths**: The application avoids a single global data file, instead opting for large, self-contained data/UI files for each major workout category (e.g., one for leg workouts, another for explosiveness workouts).
- **User-Driven Iterative Workflow**: Development follows a strict pattern of receiving user instructions and assets, performing targeted file edits, and restarting the server.

<code_architecture>
The application's content architecture is defined by separate, monolithic files that each house both the UI logic and hardcoded data for a specific, high-level workout category.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This file contains the data and UI for all Legs Day workouts. While it was the focus of previous work, it was only read in this trajectory during the initial, incorrect search for the Build Explosion section.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: No changes were made to this file in the current trajectory.

- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the most critical file for the work performed in this trajectory. It was discovered during this session and serves as the data and view monolith for the entire Build Explosion workout path. It contains the hardcoded workout database for seven different equipment types: Battle Ropes, Plyo Box, Med Ball, Sled, Kettle Bell, Sand Bag, and Body Weight Only.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was edited extensively. The  property was populated for all beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts across all seven equipment categories, totaling 63 individual workout updates. The updates were performed sequentially as the user provided images for each category, starting with Battle Ropes and concluding with Sled.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicit pending tasks. The AI has systematically worked through and completed image population for all equipment types within the Build Explosion workout path as requested by the user. The final requested section, Sled, has been updated.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was the completion of the Build Explosion section by populating the final equipment type: **Sled**.

1.  **User Request**: The user provided five image artifacts with corresponding labels and instructed: use these for sled.
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI correctly located the  data object within the workout database constant. It then executed nine distinct  commands, mapping the user-provided images to the  property of the nine Sled workouts across the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulty levels.
4.  **Final Action**: After successfully updating all nine workouts, the AI restarted the Expo server using the command expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started to apply the changes.
5.  **Where the work left off**: The trajectory concludes immediately after the server restart confirmation. The AI has not yet sent its standard summary message to the user to confirm the completion of the Sled section and the entire Build Explosion path. This final communication step is the only remaining part of the task.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Provide the user with a final summary confirming that all workouts for the Sled equipment have been updated and that the entire Build Explosion section is now complete.
