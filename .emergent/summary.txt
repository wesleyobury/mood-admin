The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on an Expo mobile application, initially addressing swipe functionality and progress bar standardization from previous tasks. The primary focus then shifted to implementing a new Build Explosiveness workout path. This involved removing an existing mood card, creating new selection screens, and developing equipment-specific workout displays (). The AI meticulously copied and adapted UI components from  to create swipeable workout cards and guidance screens. Significant effort was dedicated to precisely matching design specifications from reference screenshots, including card dimensions, text styles, gradients, button positioning, and padding. The AI also managed extensive data integration, populating the new workout path with detailed routines for multiple equipment types (Battle Ropes, Plyometric Box, Medicine Ball, Sled/Prowler, Kettlebell, Sandbag, Bodyweight), and subsequently updated all workout summaries and intensity reasoning based on explicit user feedback. Throughout, the AI prioritized exact UI/UX replication and data accuracy through iterative refinement.

The application provides workout guidance in a native-feeling Expo mobile app. Initial work included completing Legs and Abs workout paths. Key Abs requirements involved creating  for selection, hardcoded workout data, UI/UX replication of Chest path, a single-row progress bar (mood, body part, intensity, equipment), bidirectional swiping, and clickable dots.

Recent explicit requirements:
1.  Extend bidirectional swipe and clickable dots (from ) to *all* other workout cards in muscle gainer and i want to sweat paths.
2.  Standardize progress bars in muscle gainer and i want to sweat paths to a single-row format, mirroring Abs.
3.  **New Feature: Build Explosiveness Path:**
    -   Remove I want a light sweat mood card.
    -   Create a Build Explosiveness entry from the home screen.
    -   Duplicate workout type selection (from I want to sweat) for Explosiveness, with Body weight and Weight based options.
    -   For Body weight, copy  for equipment selection (Battle Ropes, Plyo Box, Bodyweight Only, Med Ball, Sled, Kettlebell, Sandbag).
    -   Implement Your Workouts screen (e.g., Battle Ropes) identical to I want to sweat workout cards (format, layout, height, photos, fonts, gradients, button, padding, borders).
    -   Ensure 3 swipeable workout cards per intensity level per equipment type.
    -   Implement comprehensive hardcoded workout data (titles, duration, reasoning, summaries, tips, plans) for all explosiveness equipment types, with precise text and formatting.
    -   Standardize mood card/header text to Build Explosive.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major phase of implementing the Build Explosiveness workout path for the Body weight category. This involved replicating a complex UI/UX from existing workout paths and integrating extensive, precise workout data.

Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Navigation and Entry Points:** The home screen () was updated to remove the i want a light sweat mood card and add an entry for Build Explosiveness. A new screen, , was created for selecting Body weight or Weight based training, and its mood text was standardized to Build Explosive.
2.  **Equipment Selection:**  was created, mirroring the  structure, but configured with seven specific explosiveness equipment types (Battle Ropes, Plyo Box, Bodyweight Only, Med Ball, Sled, Kettlebell, Sandbag). This screen also displays Build Explosive for mood text.
3.  **Workout Display ():** This is the most complex component recently worked on. It was developed based on , featuring  for swipeable workout cards.
    -   **Styling & Layout:** Iterative adjustments were made to achieve exact visual consistency with the I want to sweat path. This included precise card height, photo dimensions, font styles, gradients, button positioning, borders, and padding. Conflicting margins on workout cards were resolved by implementing a  with appropriate  padding.
    -   **Button & Spacing:** The 's vertical positioning and padding were fine-tuned by adding  and  to the button itself, and  to the , ensuring it matched the reference UI.
    -   **Data Integration:** All 54 workouts across the 7 bodyweight explosiveness equipment types (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) were integrated with their detailed titles, estimated durations, intensity reasoning, workout summaries, MOOD tips, and Battle Plans.
    -   **Data Correction:** The most immediate preceding task involved a comprehensive update of *all* intensity reasoning and workout summaries for these 54 workouts, as well as refining workout titles (e.g., removing intro) and adjusting specific Battle Plans according to user feedback.

The bodyweight path for Build Explosiveness is now fully functional, visually consistent, and populated with corrected, detailed workout data.
