The AI engineer's initial work focused on standardizing workout card swipe functionality and visual consistency (dot indicators, golden gradients, dot sizes, spacing) across various workout paths (Legs, Bodyweight Explosiveness, Lazy, Calisthenics, Outdoor). This involved consistently implementing  with  and  for navigation. Recent efforts centered on refining the swipe to explore section's height and dot spacing, specifically in muscle-group cards, by adjusting 's  and 's  to ensure visual parity with  and  cards. Subsequently, the focus shifted to extending the add workout to cart functionality, previously only in cardio, to the light weights path. This involved integrating cart logic (, , ) into  and ensuring the cart button's visual and functional consistency with the cardio path. The most recent task involved updating the  display to show both the mood card title and the workout sub-path for added clarity.

<product_requirements>
The application provides an interactive workout experience with Light weights, Calisthenics, Outdoor, and Cardio paths, featuring a Workout Shopping Cart.

**Previously Implemented Features & Fixes:**
*   Workout card swipe functionality with synchronized dot indicators for multiple workout types (Legs, Bodyweight Explosiveness, Lazy Path, Calisthenics, Outdoor).
*   Standardized swipe to explore section's golden gradient height and dot spacing (,  padding,  gap) across various workout cards, with dot sizes consistently 12x12px.
*   Workout Summary Formatting & Equipment Name in Progress Bar.
*   Complete Session Button & Cart Clearing, Add Workout Button Animation.
*   Biceps Workout Routing & Vertical Equipment Layout, comprehensive biceps workouts, and styling parity with other workout cards.

**Recent Explicit Requests and Current Implementation:**
1.  **Extend Add to Cart to Light weights**: Implement the add workout to cart feature for workout cards in the I want to sweat - light weights path, matching the formatting, positioning (top right corner), and functionality of the cardio-based path.
2.  **Unified Cart**: Ensure all workouts added from any path (Cardio, Light weights) appear in a single, unified cart.
3.  **Workout Guidance Integration**: Workouts in the cart should navigate users to the appropriate, pre-existing workout guidance screen.
4.  **Cart Item Display Enhancement**: In the cart, display both the mood card title and the sub-path (e.g., Cardio based, Light weights) for each workout, with appropriate spacing and visually attractive formatting. This has been implemented by modifying  to display  alongside the title.

-   ****: This file acts as the root layout for the Expo Router application. It's important because the  component is rendered here, making it globally available across all screens. No changes were directly made in the trajectory, but its role in cart visibility was confirmed.
-   ****: Displays cardio workout cards. This file served as the reference for existing cart button implementation (positioning, styling) and  swipe/dot indicator logic. Sections related to ,  hooks,  component structure, and  styles were examined. No direct modifications in this trajectory, but its code guided changes in .
-   ****: Displays Light weights workout cards. This was the primary target for adding cart functionality.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        1.  Imported  from .
        2.  Integrated  and  logic within the main component function, passing them as props to the .
        3.  Modified the  component to replace the workout count indicator () with an   button when  is false. If  is true, a checkmark () is displayed, matching the cardio path.
        4.  Added  and  styles to the stylesheet, replicating the visual appearance from .
-   ****: This file renders the user's shopping cart.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        1.  Modified the  to display  (e.g., Cardio based, Light weights) below the .
        2.  Added  and  styles to ensure proper formatting and spacing for the newly displayed sub-path.
-   ****: Manages the global state for the workout shopping cart. This file was not directly modified in the trajectory but is crucial as it provides the  hook and the underlying cart logic used across the application.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was implementing and verifying the cart item display enhancements. The user requested that the workout cards in the cart should display both the mood card title and the sub-path (e.g., cardio based, light weights) with appropriate formatting.

The AI engineer's actions (Chat Messages 61-74) involved:
1.  Identifying the  in  which is responsible for rendering individual workout items in the cart.
2.  Modifying the 's JSX structure to conditionally render the  alongside the existing .
    
3.  Adding new styles,  and , to the  block in  to control the font size, color, and spacing of the workout type text, ensuring it is visually attractive and aligned with existing design.
    
4.  Restarting the frontend after these code changes to apply and reflect them in the application. The frontend successfully restarted, and the AI engineer was preparing to provide a comprehensive summary, indicating the task was likely completed.
