The trajectory documents a systematic, user-driven process of populating image URLs for the Back workout section of a React Native application. This work follows a pattern established in previously completed sections like Triceps. The user provides an equipment name and two image files, and the AI engineer then updates the corresponding data in the codebase.

The entire process is centered on modifying a single, large, hardcoded data object named  within the file . For each of the ten equipment types tackled in this trajectory (e.g., Adjustable bench, Barbell, T bar row machine), the AI engineer performs a consistent set of actions: it locates the specific equipment's data block and executes six  operations. These operations insert the two user-provided image URLs into the  fields across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

After each equipment type is completed, the AI restarts the Expo server and provides a detailed progress summary to the user, including a list of completed and remaining equipment. The trajectory concludes after the T bar row machine section is finished, with only one equipment type, Powerlifting Platform, remaining for the Back section. The AI is currently awaiting the user's images for this final piece.

The user's language is English, and all future interactions should be conducted in English.

The primary goal is to visually enhance the application's workout screens by adding relevant images to each workout card. This task is being done section by section (e.g., Biceps, Triceps, Back).

The current focus is on the Back workout section. The user's role is to provide the name of an equipment type and two corresponding images. The engineer's task is to then integrate these images into the application.

The implementation pattern involves updating a hardcoded data object within the component file for the specific workout section. For each equipment type, six workouts (two for Beginner, two for Intermediate, and two for Advanced) must have their empty  property populated with the provided image URLs. This process is repeated for every piece of equipment in the Back section until it is fully complete. So far, 10 out of 11 equipment types have been updated.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data**: Workout data (equipment, exercises, image URLs) is not fetched from an API but is hardcoded as a large constant object directly within its corresponding React Native component.
- **Repetitive File Editing**: The core development workflow consists of a repeated cycle of locating and replacing empty  strings within the hardcoded data structure using file edit commands.
- **Expo Development Cycle**: The standard procedure is to edit the code, restart the Metro bundler (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: ERROR (abnormal termination)), and then report progress to the user.

<code_architecture>
The application's content is structured by muscle group, with each section having its own dedicated component file that contains both UI logic and hardcoded data.

**Directory Structure:**


   - ****
      - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the single most critical file for the Back workout feature. It contains the React component for rendering the UI and the entire data source for all back workouts, stored in a large constant named . This tight coupling of data and presentation is the established architectural pattern for workout content.
      - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: This file was the exclusive target of all modifications in the trajectory. For ten different equipment types (Adjustable bench, Barbell, etc.), the AI engineer performed six  operations each, for a total of 60 edits. Each edit replaced an  placeholder with a user-provided image URL. The edits were distributed across the , , and  workout arrays for each equipment type.

- Add images for the final remaining equipment type in the Back section: Powerlifting Platform. The user needs to provide the two images for this task to be started.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved completing the image population for the T bar row machine within the Back workout section. This was the tenth equipment type to be updated in this section.

The established workflow was followed precisely:
1.  **User Input**: The user provided two images for the T bar row machine.
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI located the  data object within the  constant. It then executed six separate  commands to insert the two provided image URLs into the  properties for the two workouts in each of the , , and  difficulty levels.
4.  **Final Action**: After all six edits were successfully completed, the Expo server was restarted using expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started. A comprehensive summary was then sent to the user, confirming the completion of the T bar row machine updates, listing the ten completed equipment types, and highlighting that only Powerlifting Platform remains to finish the Back section. The AI is now awaiting the necessary images from the user to proceed.
