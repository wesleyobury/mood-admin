The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on an Expo mobile application, continuing the development of the Build Explosiveness workout path. The primary task in this session was to standardize the length and display of intensity reason and workout summary texts on workout cards within  for consistent two-line presentation. The AI engineer first addressed Sandbag workouts, meticulously adjusting text to 70-80 characters. Following user feedback, the task was extended to all other bodyweight explosiveness equipment types (Battle Ropes, Plyometric Box, Medicine Ball, Sled/Prowler, Kettlebell, Bodyweight), with a target of 60-70 characters per text field. This involved extensive iterative file edits, systematically modifying workout data across numerous entries. The AI demonstrated persistence and meticulousness in ensuring visual consistency by updating over 50 workout entries, frequently confirming progress with the user and restarting the frontend to apply changes.

<product_requirements>
The application provides native-feeling workout guidance. Prior work established Legs and Abs paths with specific UI/UX for equipment selection, hardcoded data, swipeable workout displays, and a standardized single-row progress bar (mood, body part, intensity, equipment).

Recent explicit requirements included:
1.  Extend bidirectional swipe and clickable dots to all muscle gainer and i want to sweat workout cards.
2.  Standardize progress bars in muscle gainer and i want to sweat paths to the single-row Abs format.
3.  Implement a new Build Explosiveness Path:
    -   Remove I want a light sweat card from the home screen.
    -   Add a Build Explosiveness entry point.
    -   Create a workout type selection for Explosiveness (Body weight, Weight based).
    -   For Body weight, develop an equipment selection screen (Battle Ropes, Plyo Box, Bodyweight Only, Med Ball, Sled, Kettlebell, Sandbag).
    -   Implement Your Workouts screen for each equipment type, replicating existing workout card UI/UX (format, layout, height, photos, fonts, gradients, button, padding, borders) with 3 swipeable cards per intensity level per equipment.
    -   Integrate comprehensive, hardcoded workout data (titles, duration, reasoning, summaries, tips, plans).
    -   Standardize mood card/header text to Build Explosive.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The primary home screen displaying workout path entry points.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Removed the i want a light sweat mood card and updated navigation to include the new Build Explosiveness path, directing to .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Reference screen for equipment and intensity selection.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Used as a structural template for .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Defines the layout for workout type selection screens.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Served as a reference for creating .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Generic workout display, serving as the benchmark for UI/UX (swipeable cards, progress bar, styling).
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Heavily referenced for replicating card styling, layout, spacing, and FlatList implementation in . No direct modifications in this trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** New screen for selecting Body weight or Weight based within the Build Explosiveness path.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created to mimic  structure. Initial routes to placeholders were updated to navigate to . The progress bar/header mood text was set to Build Explosive.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** New equipment selection screen for the Body weight explosiveness path.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Duplicated from , updated with specific explosiveness equipment. Routes to . Mood text updated to Build Explosive.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Displays actual workout cards for Body weight explosiveness, featuring swipeable content and detailed workout data.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created by adapting 's structure. Extensive styling adjustments were made for card height, fonts, gradients, button placement, and padding.  with  resolved conflicting margins. The mood text was consistently Build Explosive. Loaded with detailed hardcoded workout data for Battle Ropes, Plyometric Box, Medicine Ball, Sled/Prowler, Kettlebell, Sandbag, and Bodyweight, organized by difficulty. All 54 workout titles, intensity reasoning, and workout summaries were updated in the previous task. **Crucially, in this trajectory, all  and  fields for Sandbag workouts were updated to be 70-80 characters, and for all other equipment types (Battle Ropes, Plyometric Box, Medicine Ball, Sled/Prowler, Kettlebell, Bodyweight), they were updated to be 60-70 characters to ensure consistent two-line spacing on workout cards.**
-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance:** Temporary placeholder screens for explosiveness workouts.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created, then deleted after the structured equipment flow was implemented.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Progress Bar Standardization (Legs Path):** The  file's progress bar has not been updated to the new single-row, icon-based format (mood card, muscle group, intensity level, # of equipment selected) as implemented in other muscle gainer paths.
-   Implement the weight based explosiveness workout path, starting with its equipment selection and workout display screens.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work involved a comprehensive text consistency update across all workout cards in . The user requested standardizing the  and  (workout summary) fields to ensure they consistently display on two lines, improving visual layout.

Specifically, the AI engineer:
1.  **Sandbag Workouts:** Modified all 9 sandbag workouts (3 beginner, 3 intermediate, 3 advanced) to ensure both their  and  fields were approximately 70-80 characters long.
2.  **Other Equipment Workouts:** Extended this task to all remaining equipment types in the Body weight explosiveness path: Battle Ropes, Plyometric Box, Medicine Ball, Sled/Prowler, Kettlebell, and Body Weight Only. For these, the  and  fields for each workout (totaling 45 more workouts) were adjusted to be approximately 60-70 characters long.
This required systematically traversing the hardcoded workout data within  and performing numerous targeted  operations. The goal was successfully achieved, ensuring all relevant workout text now consistently spans two lines for a polished user interface.
