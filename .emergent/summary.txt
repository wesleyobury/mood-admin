The trajectory documents a highly structured and repetitive workflow for populating a React Native application with workout images. The user drives the process by providing a muscle subgroup (e.g., hammies), an equipment type (e.g., barbell), and corresponding image files. The AI engineer's role is to locate the correct data object within the monolithic file  and update the  properties for beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts.

This process was systematically applied across three major muscle groups: Hamstrings, Quadriceps, and Calves. For each equipment type, the AI consistently performed a series of  commands, followed by a expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: ERROR (abnormal termination) command to apply the changes, and concluded with a detailed progress report for the user. A notable interaction was the user providing a specific correction for a single image, which the AI successfully handled.

The trajectory concludes after successfully updating the Calves Press Machine section, marking the completion of all requested updates for the Hamstrings, Quadriceps, and Calves muscle groups. The AI is now in an idle state, awaiting the user's next directive for a new muscle group or equipment type.

The user's language is English. All future interactions should be in English.

The project's primary goal is to enhance the user experience of a fitness application by adding visual aids (images) to each exercise. The development process is iterative and driven by the user, who acts as the product owner and asset provider.

The core task involves updating a hardcoded database within the application's frontend. For each muscle group (e.g., Hamstrings, Quads, Calves) and equipment type (e.g., Barbell, Dumbbells), the engineer receives images from the user and inserts their URLs into the corresponding  fields for all workout variations (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

To date, this process has been successfully completed for the Compound Legs, Glutes, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, and Calves sections. The application's UI for these specific workouts is now visually populated, representing a significant step towards the overall goal of a fully visualized workout library. The next phase will likely involve tackling a new muscle group, following the same established workflow.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data**: Workout information, including exercises, plans, and image URLs, is stored in large constant arrays directly within a component file, not fetched from a backend API.
- **Monolithic Component File**: A single file () contains both the UI rendering logic and the entire hardcoded dataset for multiple, distinct muscle groups (Hamstrings, Quads, Calves, etc.).
- **Repetitive Update Workflow**: The development cycle is a consistent loop: receive user assets -> locate data block in the monolithic file -> execute multiple  commands -> restart the server -> report completion.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's content architecture is defined by a single, monolithic file that houses both UI logic and hardcoded data for numerous workout categories. All work has been concentrated in this file.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the most critical file for the tasks described. It functions as a data and view monolith for the entire Legs day workout section, including the sub-categories of Compound Legs, Glutes, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, and Calves. It contains the React Native component for rendering the UI as well as the hardcoded , , and  constants that store all exercise data.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: The file was edited extensively throughout the trajectory to populate the  property for workouts across three major muscle groups. In total, 60 individual workouts across 10 equipment types were updated. The changes were applied systematically:
    - **Hamstrings**: Added images for Barbell, Dumbbells, Leg Curl Machine, and Roman Chair sections.
    - **Quadriceps**: Added images for Barbell and Leg Extension Machine sections.
    - **Calves**: Added images for Barbell, Calf Raise Machine, Dumbbells, and Leg Press Machine sections.
    Each update involved a series of  commands to replace placeholder or empty  strings with the URLs of user-provided images. This has resulted in a file that is now significantly more complete in its data definition for the aforementioned sections.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicit pending tasks. The AI has completed all user requests for the Hamstrings, Quadriceps, and Calves muscle groups. It is now awaiting user instruction for the next set of updates.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task involved completing the image population for the Calves muscle group. The final sub-task was updating the Leg Press Machine section.

1.  **User Input**: The user provided the instruction use these for calfs leg press machine along with two image artifacts:  and .
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI located the  data object within the  constant (around line 1645). It then executed six  commands, alternating the two provided image URLs for the  property across the beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts.
4.  **Final State**: After successfully updating all six workouts, the AI restarted the Expo server with expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started. It then sent a comprehensive summary to the user, confirming the completion of the Leg Press Machine section and, by extension, the entire Calves category. The AI is now idle, awaiting the user's next instruction, having successfully updated 60 workouts across 10 equipment types for the lower body.
