<analysis>
The trajectory documents the systematic population of image URLs for the Triceps workout section of a React Native application. The user initiated the task, providing images for one equipment type at a time. The AI engineer correctly identified the pattern established in previous work (like the Biceps section), which involved modifying a large, hardcoded data object within a single component file: .

The core workflow was repeated eight times, once for each equipment type: Cable Crossover Machine, Dip station / machine, Dumbbell, EZ bar, Kettle bell, Single extension cable, Tricep pushdown machine, and TRX bands. For each, the AI performed six  operations, adding two user-provided image URLs across three intensity levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). A notable incident occurred during the Tricep pushdown machine update, where an  command failed. The AI adeptly recovered by re-reading the file to get the correct string for replacement before successfully completing the edit.

After updating each equipment type (or group of them), the AI consistently restarted the Expo server and provided a detailed progress summary to the user. The trajectory concludes after all 48 workouts in the Triceps section were updated and the AI prompted the user for the next task.

The user's language is English; all future interactions should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The primary requirement is to visually enrich the application's workout sections by adding images to workout cards. The task detailed in the trajectory focuses on the Triceps section, continuing a pattern from previously completed sections.

For each of the eight specified equipment types in the Triceps section, the user provides two images. The AI's task is to populate the  property for two distinct workouts across three difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), resulting in six image updates per equipment type.

The implementation involves direct modification of a hardcoded data constant () within the  file. The trajectory confirms the successful completion of this task for all 48 Triceps workouts, covering all eight equipment types. The system now awaits direction for the next workout section to be updated.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data in Component**: All workout data, including names, plans, and image URLs, is stored in a constant () directly within the  React component.
- **Repetitive File Modification**: The development process consists of a systematic and repeated workflow of locating and updating empty  properties within the hardcoded data structure.
- **Expo Development Workflow**: The standard procedure is to edit source code, restart the Metro bundler (expo: stopped
expo: ERROR (abnormal termination)), and confirm the changes with the user.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's workout content architecture relies on hardcoding data directly into the relevant screen components, tightly coupling the UI and data for each muscle group.

**Directory Structure:**


   - ****
      - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the single critical file for the Triceps section. It contains both the React component for rendering the UI and the entire data source for the section, stored in a hardcoded constant named . This constant defines all equipment, workouts, and associated properties.
      - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: This file was the exclusive target for all 48 image URL updates across the eight Triceps equipment types. The AI engineer repeatedly located a specific equipment block (e.g., 'Cable Crossover Machine'), and populated the empty  fields with user-provided URLs. A total of 48  operations were performed on this file, along with a minor self-correction when one replacement failed due to a string mismatch.

- There are no outstanding assigned tasks. All user requests to add images for the eight specified equipment types in the Triceps section have been successfully completed. The system is awaiting the user's directive for the next task.

<current_work>
The most recent work was the completion of the entire Triceps workout section. The AI systematically processed eight equipment types, one by one, as directed by the user.

The final two equipment types handled were Tricep pushdown machine and TRX bands. A minor issue occurred with the Tricep pushdown machine where a file edit failed. The AI resolved this by re-reading the file to get the correct string for replacement and then successfully completed the edits.

Immediately following that, the AI processed TRX bands using the same established pattern:
1.  **File Edited**: .
2.  **Actions Performed**: Located the  data block and executed six  commands to insert the two user-provided image URLs into the  properties for the , , and  workouts.
3.  **Final Action**: After the final image URL was added for the final equipment type, the Expo server was restarted. A comprehensive summary was provided to the user, confirming that all 48 workouts in the Triceps section were updated. The work concluded with a prompt for user feedback and instructions for the next section.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user that the Triceps section updates are satisfactory and ask which workout section they would like to work on next (e.g., Chest, Back, Shoulders, or Legs).
