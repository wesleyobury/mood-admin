The AI engineer successfully integrated extensive workout data for nine new equipment types into the Im feeling lazy" path, ensuring a unified workout display with swipeable cards. A major challenge involved resolving persistent syntax errors due to unescaped apostrophes in string literals within `lazy-bodyweight-workouts.tsx`, which required multiple iterations and a `troubleshoot_agent` call to identify changing single quotes to double quotes as the fix. Subsequently, significant effort was dedicated to refining the progress bar UI in `lazy-bodyweight-equipment.tsx`, tackling issues like icon centering, text wrapping (to a maximum of two lines), spacing, and eliminating unwanted scrollability, drawing comparisons to the "cardio-equipment" path. The work involved continuous iterative adjustments of flexbox properties, widths, font sizes, and text content to achieve the desired static and visually consistent layout.

The application provides native-feeling workout guidance, with existing "Legs" and "Abs" paths. Recent focus included enhancing the "Build Explosiveness" path with "Body weight" and "Weight based" options, comprehensive hardcoded workout data, and standardized "Build Explosive." text. Key UI/UX elements like bidirectional swipe, clickable dots, and single-row icon-based progress bars were established. The current phase centers on developing the "Im feeling lazy path, starting from the home screen. This path requires a new  screen for Just move your body or Lift weights selection, followed by an equipment selection screen () for Just move your body with specific equipment (Treadmill, Stationary bike, etc.). Finally, a unified Your Workouts screen () must display workout cards for the selected equipment, incorporating specific data (e.g., Assault Bike workout data, 4 workouts per intensity for Bodyweight Only), while maintaining full UI/UX parity with existing paths.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Primary home screen, entry point for the application.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Updated to navigate Im feeling lazy" mood card to `lazy-training-type.tsx`.
-   **`frontend/app/lazy-training-type.tsx`**:
    -   **Importance:** New screen for "Im feeling lazy path to select Just move your body or Lift weights.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created by duplicating . Modified card text to fit on single lines and description on four lines, ensuring consistent dimensions. Navigation updated to .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Equipment selection screen for Im feeling lazy" > "Just move your body" path. This file has been the focus of recent UI/UX improvements.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Initially duplicated from `weight-equipment.tsx`, styled for stacked format, and navigation to `lazy-bodyweight-workouts.tsx`. Recent changes include:
        -   Alphabetical reordering of equipment options.
        -   Removal of the "difficulty" step from the progress bar.
        -   Multiple iterations to fix progress bar icon centering, spacing, and text wrapping to a maximum of two lines. This involved adjusting `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `flex`, `justifyContent`, `fontSize`, `lineHeight`, and removing `ScrollView` in favor of a static `View` to prevent scrolling.
        -   The latest changes aimed at making the progress bar truly static, ensuring all three steps ("Feeling lazy", "Move body", "Equipment") are fully visible and centered within the screen bounds without any scroll capability, by aggressively adjusting widths and spacing.
-   **`frontend/app/lazy-bodyweight-workouts.tsx`**:
    -   **Importance:** Displays workout cards for "Im feeling lazy > Just move your body path, serving as a unified workout screen for all equipment types in this path.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created by duplicating . Integrated Assault Bike and subsequently 9 additional equipment types (Treadmill, Stationary bike, Elliptical, Stair stepper, Rowing machine, SkiErg, Jump rope, Plyo box, Body weight only) with their respective workout data. Extensively modified to fix UI/UX issues, including image height, swipe indicators, gradients, padding/layout for overflow, workout card height,  button text spacing, and ensuring the progress bar displayed all 4 icons in a single row without overflow. Critical fixes involved escaping apostrophes in workout descriptions by changing single quotes to double quotes, which caused server errors.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Served as a reference for styling and layout of the progress bar, specifically for achieving 2-line text wrapping and static layout.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** None directly, but its styling properties were inspected and applied to .

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was intensely focused on resolving persistent issues with the progress bar in the  screen. The user repeatedly reported that the progress bar was still scrollable and that the Equipment text was being cut off, despite previous attempts to make it static and centered.

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Re-diagnosing the Scroll Issue**: Acknowledging the user's feedback that Equip text was cut off, confirming the scrollable behavior persisted.
2.  **Aggressive Styling Adjustments**: To achieve a truly static and fully visible progress bar with centered icons, the engineer made the following adjustments in :
    *   **Container Constraints**: Added  and  to the main progress bar container to enforce strict bounds.
    *   **Layout Distribution**: Used  to distribute the three progress steps (Feeling lazy, Move body, Equipment) equally within the available width.
    *   **Step Sizing**: Further reduced the  of  to  and set  to prevent them from expanding beyond their defined size, ensuring fixed widths.
    *   **Text Sizing**: Reduced  to  and  to  for the text within each step to ensure it wraps into a maximum of two lines.
    *   **Connector Minimization**: Minimized   to  and  to  to bring the icons closer together.
3.  **Self-Verification**: The engineer took a screenshot () after these changes to verify the fix. The screenshot showed all three elements (Feeling lazy, Move body, Equipment) fully visible and properly contained within the screen, suggesting the scroll issue was finally resolved and the layout was static.

The goal was to make the progress bar static, centered, with 2-line text, and icons closer together, ensuring all content is in view without any scroll feature.
