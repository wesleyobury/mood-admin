The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's work on an Expo mobile application. Initially, the engineer was tasked with summarizing previous work and then received a new request from the user to fix leg workout cards. The primary issue involved dot indicators not updating during swipe gestures and workout duration text not being golden. The engineer initially focused on , implementing  with  and , and applying golden styling. When the user reported the issue persisted with a screenshot, the engineer debugged, identified  as the actual problematic file, recovered it after an accidental deletion, and applied the same  and styling fixes there. The process involved meticulous file inspections, use of  for recovery, and multiple frontend restarts.

The application provides a high-quality workout experience for Light weights, Calisthenics, and Outdoor paths, featuring an interactive Workout Shopping Cart and a floating cart icon.

**Current Feature Development (as of the start of the trajectory):**
1.  **Workout Summary Formatting & Equipment Name in Progress Bar:** Completed.
2.  **Complete Session Button & Cart Clearing:** Fixed to clear cart and navigate home from .
3.  **Add Workout Button Animation:** Restored and confirmed.
4.  **Swipe Functionality (Light Weights & Muscle Gainer):** Implemented for Sweat weights and all seven Muscle Gainer muscle group workout cards.
5.  **Biceps Workout Routing & Layout Fix:** Routing corrected, equipment buttons for biceps and triceps stacked vertically.
6.  **Comprehensive Biceps Workouts & Styling Parity:** Extensive biceps workout data implemented in  with UI matching .
7.  **Biceps Workout Card Styling Enhancements:** Image dimensions, golden gradient for swipe to explore and equipment header, and golden font for workout duration implemented.

**New User Request during this trajectory:**
8.  **Leg Workout Card Fixes**: The dot indicators in the swipe to explore section for leg workout cards (including sub-muscle groups like Quads, Hamstrings, etc.) must update correctly when swiping. Additionally, the workout duration text on these cards needs to be golden.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the user's report that leg workout cards still had incorrect dot indicator synchronization during swipes and lacked golden duration text, specifically for the Reverse Hack Squat card. Upon re-evaluation of the user's screenshot, it was identified that  was the relevant file, not just .

The work involved:
1.  **File Recovery:**  was accidentally cleared during an edit (Chat Message 116) and subsequently recovered using  (Chat Message 130).
2.  **Duration Text Color:** The  style in  was updated to  to make the text golden (Chat Message 134).
3.  **Swipe and Dot Synchronization:** The  implementation in  was modified to replace  with  and  callbacks, along with the necessary  (Chat Messages 149-154). This ensures that the dot indicators update in real-time as the user swipes through workout cards.
4.  **Verification:** The  in  was confirmed to already have the golden gradient (Chat Message 139).
5.  **Restart and Summary:** After applying all changes, the frontend was restarted (Chat Message 156), and a comprehensive summary was provided (Chat Message 157) explaining the fixes in both  and the critical , and requesting user verification.
