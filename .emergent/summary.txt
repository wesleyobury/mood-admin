The trajectory chronicles the iterative development of a fitness application's Calisthenics section. The work was highly user-driven, with the AI engineer acting on explicit instructions and assets provided in real-time.

The process began with adding images to the Pure bodyweight workouts, which were hardcoded in . A significant part of the work involved debugging a user-reported issue where the Pushup bars / parallettes section showed no workouts. The engineer correctly diagnosed that while the equipment was listed in the UI (), its corresponding data was missing.

Following this, the engineer was tasked with adding entirely new workout data for this section, which was provided by the user. This new data was correctly placed in the more structured  file, indicating a move towards better data organization. Subsequent tasks included adding images to this new section, implementing a specific style change to a progress bar, and finally, re-distributing existing images for the Ab wheel workouts to create more visual variety, as per a nuanced user request. The workflow was consistent: locate the file, perform edits, restart the server, and summarize.

The user's preferred language is English. All future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to fully build out the Calisthenics section of the fitness app. This involves two main types of tasks:

1.  **Content Population**: Adding new, complete workout data for equipment sections that are currently empty. The user provides all necessary text content (titles, descriptions, exercises, etc.), and the engineer is responsible for structuring this data and integrating it into the application's data model. This was recently done for the Pushup bars / parallettes equipment.

2.  **Visual Enhancement**: Adding and managing images for all workout cards within the Calisthenics path to improve user experience. This includes adding new images as they are provided and modifying existing image assignments based on evolving user requirements, such as the recent request to cycle through three different images for the Ab wheel workouts at each difficulty level.

Additionally, the user may request minor UI/UX tweaks, like the recent adjustment to the progress bar's height and padding. The overall objective is a feature-complete, visually polished, and functional Calisthenics workout experience.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data Model**: Workout data is stored in static TypeScript arrays and objects directly within the source code.
- **Inconsistent Data Location**: Data is split between component files (e.g., ) and dedicated data files (). New content is being consolidated into the latter.
- **React Native Styling**: UI styles are defined using  within component files.
- **Iterative Development**: The workflow is a tight loop of receiving user requests/assets, implementing changes, and restarting the server.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a file-based routing system with Expo Router. The core logic for the Calisthenics feature is spread across UI components and data files, demonstrating an evolving architecture where data is slowly being decoupled from presentation.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance**: This file is becoming the central repository for workout data for specific calisthenics equipment. It holds the data for Gymnast rings, Ab wheel, and, most recently, Pushup bars / parallettes.
  - **Summary of Changes**:
    1.  **Added New Data**: A large data structure for all Pushup bars / parallettes workouts (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) was created and inserted.
    2.  **Added Images**: The  property was added to all Pushup bars / parallettes workouts, using images provided by the user.
    3.  **Updated Images**: The image for the Ring Muscle-Up Prep workout was updated.
    4.  **Re-distributed Images**: The  properties for all 9 Ab wheel workouts were modified to cycle through three different images, providing more visual variety per the user's latest request.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This file renders the workout screen for a selected piece of equipment. It also contains the hardcoded data for Pure bodyweight workouts, highlighting the architectural inconsistency.
  - **Summary of Changes**: The  style object was modified to adjust the progress bar's appearance. The  property was replaced with  and  to shrink the component's height by 10px while increasing its bottom spacing by 5px.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This screen displays the list of available calisthenics equipment for the user to choose from.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was read but not modified. It was used for debugging to confirm that Pushup bars / parallettes was a selectable option, which helped diagnose that the underlying workout data was missing.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding or pending tasks. All user requests, including adding data for Pushup bars / parallettes, adding all associated images, and updating the Ab wheel image distribution, have been completed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to address the user's request to change how images are displayed for the Ab wheel workouts. Initially, each difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) used a single, repeating image for its three workouts.

The user's new requirement was to have the three available Ab wheel images distributed across the three workouts *within* each difficulty level to provide more visual variety.

To accomplish this, the AI engineer performed a series of edits on the  file. The  property for each of the nine Ab wheel workouts was systematically updated to cycle through the three different image URLs (, , ).

After successfully editing the beginner, intermediate, and advanced workout arrays, the Expo server was restarted with expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started to apply the changes. The work was concluded with a summary message to the user confirming the successful update.

<optional_next_step>
Provide a summary of the completed Ab wheel image update and ask the user what they would like to work on next.
