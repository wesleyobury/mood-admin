The trajectory details a comprehensive, iterative UI overhaul of a React Native fitness application. The initial request was to modernize the home screen () by making it more sleek and minimal. This involved reducing heavy gold glows, using subtler borders, and improving spacing. The work evolved through a series of user feedback loops, first refining the home screen's colors and then expanding the new design principles to other screens.

A significant theme emerged: changing the selection feedback for buttons. The user requested that selected items (for equipment, muscle groups, intensity, etc.) should display a subtle border change rather than a full gold background fill. This led to a large-scale refactoring effort where the engineer systematically identified and edited over 20 files (e.g., , , , and numerous  files). The process involved modifying  definitions, specifically targeting  styles. A critical incident involved the accidental corruption of , which was successfully restored using usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

The final actions involved applying this selection-style change to the last batch of equipment and muscle group screens. The AI engineer believes all requested UI changes are now complete.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to refactor the application's UI to a sleeker, more modern/minimal aesthetic. This initiative began with the home screen and expanded app-wide based on user direction.

Key requirements implemented:
1.  **Modernized Home Screen**: Reduced visual noise by removing heavy gold glows, using subtler borders, and improving typography and spacing. Key branding elements (MOOD text, social icons) retained their gold color for emphasis.
2.  **Consistent Selection Feedback**: Standardized the UI for selected items across all choice screens (e.g., equipment, muscle groups, workout types). Instead of filling the button with a gold background, the selected state is now indicated by a gold border, keeping the text white and the background transparent. This provides a cleaner, less disruptive user experience.
3.  **Broad Application**: This new design pattern has been systematically applied to numerous screens, including workout type selection, equipment selection for all muscle groups, intensity level choices, and body part selection, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout the user's journey.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Native  Refactoring**: The core work involved extensive modification of  objects to update the app's visual style.
- **Conditional Styling**: UI changes focused on updating styles applied conditionally for selected states (e.g., ).
- **Iterative UI Development**: The process followed a tight feedback loop with the user, refining and expanding changes based on continuous input.
- **Version Control Recovery**:  was used to restore a file that was accidentally corrupted during a bulk update.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase is a React Native application built with Expo, featuring a file-based routing system where UI and sometimes data are co-located in component files. The development was heavily focused on modifying style definitions within numerous screen components.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main home screen, serving as the user's landing page with mood cards. It was the starting point for the entire UI refactor.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple rounds of  edits to reduce glows, refine padding, and adjust text/icon colors to be more subtle, with specific elements retaining a gold accent for branding.

-   ** (e.g., , , etc.)**:
    -   **Importance**: These ~15 files define screens where users select equipment. They were a primary target for standardizing the selection UI.
    -   **Changes**: The  style was universally changed. The  was removed in favor of  and  to create a subtle border highlight upon selection.

-   ** (e.g., , )**:
    -   **Importance**: These screens are part of various user flows for choosing a workout category.
    -   **Changes**: Similar to equipment screens, their  styles were modified to use a border highlight instead of a background fill. Title text color was also changed to white for better contrast.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Key screens in the Muscle Gainer and Legs workout paths for selecting muscle groups.
    -   **Changes**: The  styles were refactored to use the border-highlight pattern. In , the checkmark icon color in the JSX was also updated from black to white to ensure visibility.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Improve Image Loading Performance**: The original request to work on increasing the load speed of the site, particularly the photo loading on explore and profile page has not yet been addressed. This remains the primary pending technical task.
- **User Confirmation**: Confirm with the user that the comprehensive UI updates for selection buttons meet their expectations across all modified screens.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work was the completion of a large-scale UI refactoring task. The goal was to change the visual feedback for selected items on numerous screens from a solid gold background to a more subtle gold border.

This was accomplished by systematically identifying and editing over a dozen files. The final batch of edits focused on:
1.  ****: The  style was updated to use a border, and the  checkmark color was changed from black to  in the JSX to maintain visibility.
2.  **All Remaining Equipment Screens**: A comprehensive sweep was performed on all equipment selection files (e.g., , , ). In each file, the  style was modified to remove the  and  changes, replacing them with a  and  to implement the new subtle border selection indicator.

After all files were modified, the Expo service was restarted to apply the changes. The AI engineer believes all user requests related to this UI refactor are now complete.

<optional_next_step>
I will confirm with you that the UI refactor is complete and all selection buttons behave as expected, and then ask if you are ready to move on to the pending task of improving image loading performance.
