The trajectory begins with a summary from the previous AI engineer, detailing the completion of the Legs workout path and the development of the Abs workout path. The Abs path involved creating  and , populating them with hardcoded data, and meticulously replicating the UI/UX of the Chest path, including bidirectional swiping and clickable progress dots. A persistent issue with automated screenshot tests failing to navigate to  was noted.
The current interaction initiated with a user request (Chat Message 5) to ensure all workout cards across *all* paths (i want to sweat, muscle gainer) possess the same bidirectional swipe and clickable dot functionality as the Abs path. The user clarified (Chat Message 8) to prioritize swipe functionality, stating navigation issues were fixed.
The AI engineer then proceeded to analyze various workout display files (, , , and others). The analysis confirmed that  features a complete implementation using , ,  for programmatic scrolling and clickable dots. However, other files like , while having touch-based bidirectional swiping and clickable dots, *lack* the  and programmatic scrolling mechanism. This indicates an inconsistency that needs to be addressed.

The overarching goal initially involved completing the Legs workout path, which required adding Hamstrings, Quads, and Calves, integrating hardcoded workout data, refining the progress bar to show only selected muscle groups, ensuring correct  parameters, consistent intensity display, and preventing equipment cross-contamination.

Subsequently, the primary focus shifted to building the Abs workout path. This encompassed:
1.  **Abs Equipment Screen ():** Creation of an equipment selection screen with vertically stacked, alphabetically ordered options and an intensity selection UI identical to the Chest path. The equipment list was specifically defined (e.g., Ab Roller, Captain’s Chair) with later modifications (Ab Crunch Machine, Body Weight, removal of Dumbbells, Stability Ball).
2.  **Comprehensive Abs Workouts:** Implementation of detailed hardcoded workout data for all specified Abs equipment across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulty levels.
3.  **UI/UX Duplication ():** Exact replication of the Chest path's Your Workouts display screen across all visual aspects (layout, styling, dimensions, content, colors, gradients, borders, padding).
4.  **Progress Bar Enhancements:** The Abs progress bar was to be reordered into a single row, displaying mood, body part, intensity, and selected equipment count with individual icons.
5.  **Interactive Navigation:** Implementation of bidirectional swiping for workout cards and clickable progress circles/dots.
6.  **Visual Consistency Fixes:** Ensuring golden intensity level icon backgrounds, Swipe to explore text with 1/2 indicators, and resolving a bug causing a green background for intensity reason text on intermediate/advanced cards, ensuring a uniform golden color.

The most recent product requirement is to extend the complete bidirectional swipe functionality with clickable dots (as implemented in the Abs path) to *all* other workout cards within the i want to sweat and muscle gainer paths.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Expo File-Based Routing:**  for screen navigation, files in  define routes.
-   **Monolithic Static Database:** Workout data is hardcoded within frontend display components.
-   **Conditional Rendering:** UI elements displayed/hidden based on state variables.
-   **Component Reusability/Adaptation:** UI patterns from existing features (e.g., Chest path) adapted for new ones.
-   **React Native Styling:**  for all UI styling.
-   **FlatList with useRef/scrollToIndex:** Used for efficient, interactive carousels with programmatic scrolling.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on a comprehensive overhaul of the Abs workout display () to achieve pixel-perfect UI/UX parity with the Chest workout path and enhance interactive elements. This involved:

1.  **Uniform Golden Difficulty Badges:** Resolved an issue where Intermediate and Advanced workout cards displayed a green background for intensity reason text. The fix applied a uniform golden color () to all difficulty badges, consistent with .
2.  **Enhanced Progress Bar Layout:** Reordered the progress bar at the top to a single row, prominently displaying Mood Card, Body Part, Intensity Level, and Number of Equipment Selected, each with individual icons.
3.  **Bidirectional Swiping:** Implemented functionality allowing users to swipe workout cards both right and left for fluid navigation within an equipment type's workouts.
4.  **Clickable Progress Dots:** The small circular indicators beneath the Swipe to explore section were made interactive. Tapping these dots now directly navigates to specific workout cards, leveraging  to programmatically scroll the  component.

Following these implementations, automated screenshot tests were attempted but consistently failed to navigate to . However, the user later clarified that navigation issues have been fixed (Chat Message 8).

The *immediate* current work, driven by the user's request (Chat Message 5), involves analyzing the swipe functionality across *all* workout display files. The analysis revealed that  possesses the complete implementation (FlatList with programmatic scrolling and clickable dots), while other files like  and  (and other generic  files) currently have only basic touch-based swiping and clickable dots, *lacking* the  for programmatic scrolling. This gap requires further implementation.
