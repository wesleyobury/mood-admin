**original_problem_statement**:
The user's goal for this session was an extensive content overhaul for the Biceps and Triceps sections of the application. This involved:
1.  Replacing all existing workout data for multiple equipment types with new, detailed workout plans provided by the user.
2.  Updating specific workout card images with new images provided by the user in several batches.
3.  The user also reported a bug where updated triceps workouts were not appearing, which the agent then debugged and fixed.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has performed a massive content update on the frontend data files. The files  and  have been completely updated with new workout routines for a total of 10 equipment types (6 for Biceps, 4 for Triceps initially, with more added). Additionally, numerous specific  properties within these files have been updated based on images provided by the user. The agent also identified and fixed a bug related to equipment name mismatches between the data file and the UI component.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was updating the images for 9 specific triceps workouts across the 'Cable Crossover Machine', 'Tricep Pushdown Machine', and 'TRX Bands' equipment categories. This involved editing .

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has updated all requested workout data and images for Biceps and Triceps, and fixed a bug preventing some Triceps workouts from displaying. All changes are in  and .
     - Next debug checklist: Ask the user to comprehensively review the Biceps and Triceps sections in the app. Specifically, they should check:
        1. All workout details (descriptions, battle plans, tips) are correct for all equipment types.
        2. All newly uploaded images appear for the correct workouts.
        3. The Dumbbell and Kettle bell triceps workouts are now visible (confirming the bug fix).

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Verify All Biceps & Triceps Updates**: Get explicit confirmation from the user that all content/image updates are correct and the visibility bug for triceps workouts is resolved.
- **(P1) Address High-Priority Technical Debt**: After user confirmation, you MUST proactively present the list of pending critical issues (Video player positioning, Profile fetch error, Broken search sheet, Broken admin widget) and ask the user to prioritize which one to tackle next. This session was entirely focused on content; it is critical to pivot back to fixing these bugs.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Biceps Workout Data Overhaul**: Replaced all workout data in  for:
  - Dumbbells, EZ Curl Bar, Cable Machine, Biceps Curl Machine, Preacher Curl Machine, Pull-Up Bar.

  - Recurrence count: 10+
  - Status: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Iterative Content Management**: The agent handled a high volume of sequential user requests to update a large TypeScript data object.
- **Debugging by Comparison**: The agent successfully debugged a visibility issue by comparing the data source () with the UI component consuming it () and identifying a naming inconsistency.

**key DB schema**
- No database schema changes were made. All work was on frontend data files.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Updated with all new biceps workout content and image URLs.
- : Updated with all new triceps workout content, image URLs, and corrected equipment names to fix a bug.
- : This file was inspected during debugging and contains the hardcoded equipment names that the data file must match.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The mapping between equipment names in the UI components (e.g., ) and the data files is fragile. It relies on hardcoded strings being identical. This could be refactored to use a shared constant or enum for equipment names to prevent future bugs.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were used or modified.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **START HERE**: Your first task is to get confirmation from the user that all Biceps and Triceps updates are correct. This includes all workout text, all new images, and specifically verifying that the Dumbbell and Kettle bell Triceps workouts are now visible.
2.  **PIVOT TO BUG FIXES (CRITICAL)**: This session was spent entirely on content updates, ignoring major pre-existing bugs. Once the user confirms the content is correct, you **must** pivot the conversation to addressing the technical debt. Present the list of high-priority bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget) and ask the user which one you should fix next. Do not wait for the user to bring them up.

**documents created in this job**

  - Test files created: None
  - Known regressions: None from this session's work, but major pre-existing bugs remain unaddressed.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- Continue as a guest or log in, then navigate to the Biceps and Triceps workout sections to view the extensive content and image updates.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent successfully fulfilled all the user's immediate requests for content and image updates. However, it completely ignored the critical, pre-existing bugs that were explicitly listed in the initial handover summary. The next agent's primary responsibility, after confirming the content updates, is to pivot and address this technical debt.
