The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on expanding the Add to Cart functionality to additional workout paths and resolving styling and syntax issues. Initially, the session addressed user feedback on the cart's display for Im feeling lazy > lift weights" workouts in `cart.tsx`, ensuring body part display and preventing title truncation. Subsequently, the main task involved implementing "Add to Cart" for "calisthenics path" workouts, which required extensive refactoring in `calisthenics-workouts.tsx`. This process was plagued by persistent Metro bundler syntax errors, even after multiple debugging attempts, cache clears, and ESLint validations. After resolving the calisthenics styling based on user feedback, the same "Add to Cart" feature was implemented for "outdoor activities" in `outdoor-workouts.tsx`. This also led to a persistent Metro error, indicating a recurring structural or caching problem. The AI engineer concluded by acknowledging this unresolved Metro error while stating the code is syntactically correct according to ESLint.

<product_requirements>
The application provides an interactive workout experience across categories like Light weights, Calisthenics, Outdoor, Cardio, and Muscle Gainer, featuring a "Workout Shopping Cart" that navigates users to a "workout guidance" screen. The cart previously displayed total workout count and estimated duration, with "Add to Cart" functionality implemented for "Muscle gainer - Biceps, Triceps, Legs" and "Im feeling lazy weight workouts.

Prior work addressed a routing issue for light weights, implemented Add to Cart for build explosion weight, fixed carousel reset bugs in body weight and Im feeling lazy > move your body" paths, and corrected workout card corner aesthetics. The current session specifically aimed to add "Add to Cart" to "Im feeling lazy weights (upper, lower, full body) workouts, ensure consistent button styling, and refine the cart's display to show body part details and prevent workout title truncation. Further requests included extending Add to Cart to calisthenics path and outdoor activities workouts, maintaining identical button formatting and leading to the workout guidance screen.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Served as the primary reference for Add to Cart button styling and  component structure.
    -   **Changes**: Not directly modified in this trajectory, but its code structure and styles were extensively referenced to ensure consistency across other workout screens.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays I want to do calisthenics workouts.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented Add to Cart functionality including , , , , . The  component was refactored and moved outside the main function. Significant debugging was required to resolve persistent Metro bundler syntax errors related to duplicate code sections, incorrect indentation, and improper component closure. Finally, duplicate and incorrect button styles ( and related text/icon styles) were identified and removed/corrected to match  precisely (size, shape, color, icons).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays Outdoor activities workouts.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented Add to Cart functionality. This involved adding necessary imports, moving the  component definition from inside the main function to outside, removing duplicate  definitions, and correcting  to pass all required  properties as defined in . Button styles were also adjusted to match . Despite these corrections, a persistent Metro bundler syntax error at line 389 is currently blocking the preview.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the  and the  interface, which is critical for consistency when adding items to the cart.
    -   **Changes**: Not directly modified, but its  interface was referenced to ensure correct data structures were passed to  functions.

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve the persistent Metro bundler syntax error in  which prevents the app from previewing the outdoor activities path.
-   User verification of the Add to Cart functionality and exact button styling for the calisthenics path workouts.
-   User verification of the Add to Cart functionality and exact button styling for the outdoor activities path workouts (once the Metro error is resolved).
-   Verify existing fixes: carousel reset (, , ), routing for light weights, and mood display in cart (from initial summary).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the Add to Cart functionality for the outdoor activities mood card path in . This involved:

1.  Adding necessary imports (e.g., , ).
2.  Refactoring the  component definition by moving it from inside the main  function to outside, making it a standalone  component.
3.  Removing duplicate  component definitions that were inadvertently left in the file after refactoring.
4.  Correcting the  function to ensure all required properties (e.g., , , , , , ) were correctly passed to the  function from .
5.  Adjusting the styling of the Add workout button and its animated checkmark to precisely match the  reference, covering , , , , , icon sizes, and text styles.

After these changes, the app began experiencing a persistent Metro bundler syntax error, specifically indicating an issue around line 389 in . Despite multiple attempts at debugging, clearing Metro's cache, restarting services, and running ESLint (which reported no issues), the error continues to prevent the preview of the outdoor activities path. The core functionality and styling are believed to be correctly implemented, but the bundler error remains a blocker.
