- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Verify All Content Updates**: Get explicit confirmation from the user that all Triceps and Abs updates are correct and displaying as expected.
- **(P1) Address High-Priority Technical Debt**: After user confirmation, you MUST proactively present the list of pending critical issues (Video player positioning, Profile fetch error, Broken search sheet, Broken admin widget) and ask the user to prioritize which one to tackle next. This session and the previous one were entirely focused on content; it is critical to pivot back to fixing these bugs.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Iterative Content Management**: The agent handled a high volume of sequential user requests to update large TypeScript data objects (, ). All work was on static frontend data files.

**key DB schema**
- No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Updated with new image URLs for various triceps workouts.
- : Heavily updated with dozens of new workouts, a workout replacement, and new image URLs.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The mapping between equipment names in UI components (e.g., ) and the data files is fragile. It relies on hardcoded strings being identical. This could be refactored to use a shared constant or enum for equipment names to prevent future bugs. This issue persists and is now relevant for the  file as well.

**key api endpoints**
- No API endpoints were used or modified.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **START HERE**: Your first task is to get confirmation from the user that all Triceps and Abs updates are correct. This includes all workout text, all new images, and specifically verifying the new Pull-Up Bar equipment in the Abs section.
2.  **PIVOT TO BUG FIXES (CRITICAL)**: Two full sessions have now been spent entirely on content updates, ignoring major pre-existing bugs. Once the user confirms the content is correct, you **must** pivot the conversation to addressing the technical debt. Present the list of high-priority bugs (Video Player, Profile Fetch, Web Search, Admin Widget) and ask the user which one you should fix next. Do not wait for the user to bring them up.

**documents created in this job**
- None.

  - Known regressions: None from this session's work, but major pre-existing bugs remain unaddressed.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- Continue as a guest or log in, then navigate to the Triceps and Abs workout sections to view the extensive content and image updates.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent successfully fulfilled all the user's immediate requests for content and image updates. However, for the second consecutive session, it completely ignored the critical, pre-existing bugs that were explicitly listed in the initial handover summary. The next agent's primary responsibility, after confirming the content updates, is to pivot and address this technical debt.
