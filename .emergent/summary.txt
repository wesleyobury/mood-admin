The trajectory documents an intensive, iterative UI alignment process for a React Native application. The core task, driven by granular user feedback, was to make workout cards in various paths (Lazy Your Body, Calisthenics, Outdoor Activities) visually consistent with a reference Cardio path defined in .

The previous engineer's workflow consisted of a repetitive cycle:
1.  Receive a specific visual tweak request from the user (e.g., increase margin by 5px).
2.  Identify the relevant workout file (e.g., ).
3.  Read the current styles in that file and often compare them against the  reference.
4.  Execute one or more file edits using search-and-replace to modify  properties like , , , , and .
5.  Restart the Expo server to apply changes.
6.  Summarize the changes and await further user feedback.

This process was applied systematically across multiple files, also addressing layout issues on adjacent equipment selection screens (e.g., ). The work was highly conversational and detail-oriented, focusing on achieving pixel-perfect consistency. The most recent task involved a comprehensive style overhaul of the  card and its corresponding equipment page.

The user's primary language is English, and future communications should continue in English.

<product_requirements>
The primary product requirement is to enforce complete visual and layout consistency for the workout card UI component across all workout paths in the application.

**Problem:** Different workout paths (, , , etc.) exhibit inconsistent styling for their workout cards. This includes variations in card height, button positioning, header size, font sizes, progress bar appearance, and internal spacing, creating a disjointed user experience.

**Source of Truth:** The UI implementation in the Sweat Based path, located at , serves as the definitive design standard that all other cards must replicate.

**Implementation So Far:** The engineer has systematically aligned cards for the Lazy Your Body, Calisthenics, and Outdoor Activities paths. This involved a multi-step, iterative debugging process to align card heights, header sections, description spacing, and button positions. Spacing on related equipment selection screens was also corrected to ensure a consistent feel across the user flow.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Native **: The primary mechanism for UI styling, involving iterative adjustments of properties like , , , , and .
- **Comparative Debugging**: The core workflow involved comparing the  files for various workout paths against the reference  file to identify and reconcile style differences.
- **Style Precedence & Inline Styles**: A recurring issue was discovering and modifying inline styles (e.g., ) that overrode  definitions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Expo file-based routing architecture. All navigable screens are React Native components located in the  directory.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file contains the styles for the Cardio Based path and serves as the **source of truth** for all workout card UI styling.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was only read for comparison and was not modified.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file for the Just Move Your Body path was the first to be adjusted in this trajectory.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  style's  property was iteratively changed from an initial  to  in 5px increments based on user feedback.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file for the Calisthenics path underwent a major style overhaul to match the reference.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Numerous styles were updated, including: changing an inline  to ; adjusting , , , , and  styles; and iteratively increasing the 's  from  to . The description text color was also changed to white.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the equipment selection screen for the Calisthenics path.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  style's  was reduced from  to  to fix excessive spacing at the bottom of the screen.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file for the Outdoor Activities path was the most recent subject of a major style overhaul.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: A large number of styles were updated in bulk to match the reference, including , , , and . A final fix was applied to the  style which had been missed in the initial bulk edit.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The equipment selection screen for the Outdoor path.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  style's  was reduced from  to .

<current_work>
The most recent task was a comprehensive styling fix for the Outdoor Activities path to match the Sweat Based reference. The user reported multiple discrepancies, including issues with a shaded region, progress bar padding, and spacing between cards, as well as on the equipment selection screen.

The engineer discovered that a previous bulk update had missed key properties on the main  style. The final actions involved correcting this and other styles.

**Files Edited:**
1.  ****
    -   **Action:** The  style object was updated to match the reference.
    -   **Changes:**  (16 to 20),  (1 to 2),  (alpha 0.6 to 0.3),  (10 to 15),  (5 to 8), and  (20 to 25).  was also added.

2.  ****
    -   **Action:** The  style was updated to reduce bottom spacing.
    -   **Change:** The  property was updated from  to .

Following these edits, the Expo server was restarted. The application is now pending user validation to confirm these final adjustments are correct.

<optional_next_step>
Wait for the user to review the latest changes to the Outdoor Activities cards and equipment screen, then ask if they are correct or if further adjustments are needed.
