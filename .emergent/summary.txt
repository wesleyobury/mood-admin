The previous AI engineer focused on extending and refining the Muscle gainer paths in the MOOD app, specifically the Shoulders and Chest sections. Initially, the Shoulders path was built, establishing UI/UX patterns for equipment selection and workout display, including a 3-line summary format for workout cards and detailed battle plans for guidance screens. A significant bug involving the Rear Delt Fly Machine equipment name inconsistency was identified and resolved.

Subsequently, the user requested applying these refined patterns to the Chest workouts. This involved a major refactor of  to separate 3-line workout summaries from detailed battle plans, standardize card dimensions, and shorten  descriptions to fit within 3 lines. Bug fixes were also addressed, including inconsistencies in the Pec dec machine name and issues with the progress bar's display and layout. The progress bar was formatted to mirror the shoulders path, showing equipment and intensity levels, and adjusted to display 3 icons per row. The current task involves standardizing all workout card titles to a single line across both chest and shoulders paths, with chest titles already updated.

The MOOD app aims to provide personalized, dark-themed workout recommendations with gold accents and bottom tab navigation. The initial goal was to expand the Muscle gainer section to include Shoulders with:
1.  **Equipment Screens**:  with specific, alphabetized equipment.
2.  **Workout Display Screens**:  duplicating UI/UX of Chest (swipeable cards, non-scrollable progress bar, start button).
3.  **Workout Content**: Populating screens with Dumbbells and Barbells shoulder workouts, later expanded to 8 additional equipment types, totaling 60 workouts.
4.  **Summary Formatting**: Workout cards initially had 1-line summaries, later refined to consistently display in *exactly 3 lines*.
5.  **Battle Plan Separation**: Detailed battle plans were exclusively for guidance screens, while workout cards retained 3-line summaries.
6.  **Equipment Renaming**: Pec Dec Rear Delt Fly was renamed to Rear Delt Fly Machine consistently.

Recent requests extended these patterns to the Chest path:
7.  **Chest Workout Format**: Apply the same 1-line summary/3-line spacing for workout cards ( field) and detailed battle plans for guidance screens ( field).
8.  **Chest Card Dimensions**: Standardize all chest workout cards to the *same height and dimensions* as shoulder workout cards.
9.  **Intensity Reason Consistency**: Shorten all  descriptions in chest workout cards to be *no more than 3 lines consistently*.
10. **Pec dec machine Consistency**: Revert the equipment name to Pec dec machine in selection and update corresponding workout names to match.
11. **Progress Bar Formatting**: The chest path progress bar must mirror the *shoulders path format*, showing each selected equipment and intensity level, be *non-scrolling and fit all items in view*.
12. **Progress Bar Spacing**: Add *more spacing/padding* between the progress bar and the first workout card in the chest path.
13. **Workout Card Shading**: Add *slight neon shading* at the bottom of the chest workout cards.
14. **Progress Bar Layout**: Ensure each row in the progress bar fits *up to 3 icons*.
15. **Workout Card Title Standardisation**: Standardize the title of *every workout card* in both chest and shoulders paths to *1 line*.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with standardizing the titles of all workout cards across both the chest and shoulders paths to ensure they fit on exactly one line, preventing formatting issues where long titles wrap and disrupt card layout.

The AI engineer has completed the first part of this task:
1.  **Identified the problem**: Recognized that workout titles like Decline Plyo Push-Ups were extending to two lines in chest workouts.
2.  **Analyzed current titles**: Examined  fields in both  and  to identify titles that were too long.
3.  **Implemented fix for Chest workouts**: Systematically went through  and shortened all workout titles to be more concise and fit on a single line, using the  tool to efficiently update the file.

The  file has been updated with these shortened titles. The next step is to apply the same standardization to the shoulders workout titles.
