The trajectory details a systematic process of populating workout image URLs for the Legs section of a React Native application. This work is a direct continuation of a previously established pattern from the Shoulders section. The user drives the process by providing an equipment name and corresponding images. The AI engineer's task is to locate the relevant data structure within the  file and update the  fields for beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts.

Initially, the AI struggled to locate the correct file, trying several patterns before identifying  as the central file for this task. This single, monolithic file contains the hardcoded data for multiple workout categories, including Compound Legs and Glutes.

The AI successfully updated ten equipment types: Dumbbells, Hack Squat Machine, Leg Press Machine, Single Stack Cable Machine (for both compound and glutes), Squat Rack, Trap Bar, Glute Kick Machine, Hip Abductor Machine, and Hip Thruster Equipment. For each, the AI performed multiple file edits, restarted the Expo server, and provided a detailed progress report. The trajectory concludes after completing the Hip Thruster Equipment, marking significant progress on the Legs section. The AI is now awaiting user feedback and direction for the next task. The user's preferred language is English.

The primary objective is to visually enhance the application's workout screens by integrating user-provided images for each exercise. The current focus is on the Legs muscle group, which is subdivided into categories like Compound and Glutes within the codebase.

The established workflow is iterative and user-driven. The user provides an equipment name (e.g., Hack Squat Machine) and two or more image files. The engineer is then responsible for updating the  properties for all associated workouts (typically two each for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels) within a hardcoded data structure.

To date, this process has been successfully executed for ten equipment blocks in the Legs section, including Dumbbells, Squat Rack, Leg Press Machine, and Hip Thruster Equipment. The task is considered complete for these items, and the application's UI for these specific workouts is now visually populated. The overall goal is to continue this process until all workout sections have corresponding images.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Hardcoded Data**: Workout data is stored in a large constant array within a component file, not fetched from an API.
- **Monolithic Component File**: A single file, , contains both the UI logic and the hardcoded data for multiple workout categories (Compound, Glutes, Hamstrings).
- **Repetitive Update Workflow**: The core development cycle consists of locating a data block, performing a series of  operations to replace  strings, restarting the server, and reporting progress.

<code_architecture>
The application's content is structured by workout type, with a single, large file containing the data and UI for multiple related categories.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the single most critical file in the trajectory. It acts as a monolithic source for compound, glute, and hamstring workouts. It contains the React component for rendering the UI and the entire hardcoded data source () for all exercises within these categories. All development work in the provided trajectory was performed exclusively on this file.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: This file was edited extensively to add image URLs for ten different equipment types within the Legs (Compound and Glutes) section. This involved 63 separate  operations targeting the  property for workouts across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. The updated equipment includes Dumbbells, Hack Squat Machine, Leg Press Machine, Single Stack Cable Machine, Squat Rack, Trap Bar, Glute Kick Machine, Hip Abductor Machine, and Hip Thruster Equipment. The  fields for these sections are now fully populated.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicit pending tasks. All user requests to update workout images for the Legs section (Compound and Glutes) have been completed for the 10 specified equipment types. The next action is contingent on the user's direction.

<current_work>
The most recent task was the completion of the Hip Thruster Equipment image updates within the Legs these for glutes hip thruster equipment along with two image files:  and .
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI located the  data object within the  constant (starting at line 181). It then executed six  commands to insert the two provided image URLs into the  properties for the beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts.
4.  **Final Action**: After successfully editing the file, the AI restarted the Expo server using expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started. It then sent a comprehensive summary to the user, confirming the completion of the Hip Thruster Equipment and providing an overall progress report for the Legs section. The AI is now idle, awaiting the user's next instruction.
