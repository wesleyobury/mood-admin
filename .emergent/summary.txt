[07:54:54] and  services multiple times to refresh the ngrok tunnel. After several failed attempts, the agent correctly identified the active tunnel URL () by querying the local ngrok API.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1.  Ask the user to confirm if they can connect to the mobile preview by either:
            a. Manually entering the provided URL in Expo Go.
            b. Refreshing the web preview page to get a new QR code and scanning that.
        2.  If the issue persists, the problem may be network-related on the user's side or a deeper issue with the Expo tunnel configuration.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? The user cannot test the application on their mobile device, which is critical for a mobile app development workflow.
     - Status:  USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - Is recurring issue? Y (within this session)
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A (User verification needed)
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: **None in this session.** This was the highest priority task from the previous handover and was completely ignored. The agent ran a linter, which identified a  in , but dismissed it as a linter configuration problem. This error is the most likely cause of the button not rendering and must be investigated.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1.  **Fix the syntax error** reported by the linter at or around line 132 in . Do not dismiss this error.
        2.  Once fixed, verify that the bookmark/save button is visible on the home screen carousel cards.
        3.  Test the save/unsave functionality.
        4.  Confirm that unsaving a workout from the profile page correctly updates the icon on the home page carousel (using ).
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a critical, user-facing bug that breaks the core Saved Workouts feature.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

  - Issue 3: 
     - Attempted fixes: **None in this session.** This was a high-priority task from the previous handover that was also ignored.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. Save a featured workout.
        2. Navigate to the profile page and tap the saved workout.
        3. Confirm it navigates to the detailed  page, not a generic modal.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? Fixes a broken user experience for a core feature.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: Blocked by Issue 2, as saving workouts is currently broken/untestable.

  - Issue 4, 5, 6:
     - Attempted fixes: **None in this session.** These were carried over from the previous fork and were not addressed.
     - Status: NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **P1: Implement Apple Sign-In**: Requested by the user in a previous session but deferred.
    - **P2: Implement Email Sign-Up/Sign-In**: The final part of the user's original authentication request, also deferred.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **P0: Refactor Hardcoded Data (CRITICAL)**: Workout data is hardcoded in  and other files. This session again proved this is a problem, as the agent had to manually edit the source code to change an image URL. This data must be moved to the backend.
    - **P1: Refactor Styles**: The lack of a centralized styling system makes UI changes inefficient.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Feature: Unsave from Profile**:
  - Added a delete button ( icon) to each saved workout card in .
  - The button successfully calls the  function.
- **Feature: Camera in Post Creation**:
  - Added Take Photo and Take Video buttons in .
  - Implemented  to allow users to capture new media.
- **UI/Content Updates**:
  - Resolved initial blank screen by restarting services.
  - Updated the calisthenics workout image in the hardcoded data in .
  - Restyled the create post page () for a more modern, less gold-focused look.
  - Updated text and the header logo on the welcome screen ().
- **Logic Confirmation**:
  - Verified and confirmed the backend API endpoints used for the For You () and Following () tabs in .
- **Bug Investigation**:
  - Troubleshooted and identified the likely cause of the endpoint offline mobile preview error.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
The agent did not address the primary bugs it was tasked with fixing at the start of the session. It was sidetracked by new user requests.
   - **Issue 1**: **Home screen carousel save button is not visible.** A linter error  was found in  but was incorrectly dismissed by the agent. This is the likely root cause and remains unfixed.
   - **Issue 2**: **Saved featured workouts on the profile page open a generic modal instead of the detail page.** This was not worked on.
   - **Issue 3**: Unfollow analytics tracking is not working. (Recurring)
   - **Issue 4**: The Intermed. intensity text on  is gold instead of white. (Recurring)

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Unfollow tracking and the Intermed. text color bug.
  - **Recurrence count**: 4+
  - **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Expo Go Tunnel Debugging**: Investigating endpoint offline errors by checking service status, logs, and using  to query the local ngrok agent for the active public URL.
- **React Native Styling**: Using  positioning to overlay an icon onto a card component in .
- **Image Picker**: Using  to access the device's camera for both photos and videos.
- **Hardcoded Data**: The session continued the pattern of modifying hardcoded data directly in component files (), reinforcing the need for refactoring.

**All files of reference**
- : (Home screen) Contains critical, unfixed bug.
- : (Profile screen) New 'unsave' feature was added here.
- : (Post creation) Camera feature and major restyling done here.
- : (Welcome screen) Text and logo were updated here.
- : (Explore screen) Logic was confirmed here.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **CRITICAL: Centralize Workout Data**: This remains the most significant source of technical debt. All hardcoded workout data in frontend components (, etc.) must be migrated to the database and served via a backend API. This would have turned the update image task from a code edit into a data change.

**key api endpoints**
- : Confirmed to fetch the For You feed.
- : Confirmed to fetch the Following feed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **First, confirm with the user if the mobile preview connection issue is resolved.** They may be blocked. Guide them to use the correct ngrok URL or re-scan the QR code.
2.  **Your IMMEDIATE and HIGHEST priority is to fix the original bugs from the previous session, which were completely ignored.**
    *   **Tackle  first.** The save/bookmark button is not rendering. A linter error, , was found and dismissed. **DO NOT dismiss this error.** It is almost certainly a syntax issue breaking the render tree. Fix it.
    *   After fixing the rendering, thoroughly test the entire save/unsave workflow, which is the app's core functionality.
3.  **Do not get sidetracked by new, lower-priority user requests.** Politely inform the user that you need to fix the critical, existing bugs first to ensure the app is stable before adding new features.
4.  After the critical bugs are fixed, propose the **backend refactoring of workout data** as the next major task. Explain that this will prevent future bugs and make content updates much easier.

**documents created in this job**

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User**: change text on welcome screen. **Status:** Completed.
2.  **User**: give  page a new theme and confirm explore page logic. **Status:** Completed.
3.  **User**: use this image as the header icon on the welcome screen. **Status:** Completed.
4.  **User**: im getting an endpoint offline error when trying to preview on mobile. **Status:** In Progress (agent provided a fix, user verification pending).
5.  **User**: im still getting this error when trying to view. **Status:** In Progress.
6.  **User**: im still getting the same endpoint offline error. **Status:** In Progress.
7.  **PENDING USER ACTION:** The user needs to try connecting to the mobile preview again with the new information provided by the agent. All other requests from this session have been addressed, but the most critical bugs from the *previous* session remain untouched.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**:
    - **Home Screen Save/Unsave**: The bookmark button is not visible on carousel cards due to a likely syntax error in . The entire feature is broken.
    - **Mobile Preview Connection**: The user cannot connect via Expo Go. The issue is under investigation, with a potential fix pending user verification.
- **Mocked**:
    - **All Workout Data**: All workout details remain hardcoded in the frontend, leading to technical debt and inefficient updates.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- No new integrations were added.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: The save/bookmark button on the home screen carousel, which was the target of a bug fix, is now completely gone due to a new error introduced in the previous fork and not fixed in this one.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- Use the Try Demo flow on the login screen.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent failed to work on the primary tasks from the previous handover summary. It was completely sidetracked by the user's new requests.
- **Forgot to fix the home screen carousel save button rendering bug** in .
- **Forgot to test/fix the display logic for saved featured workouts** from the profile page.
- **Forgot to address pending minor issues:** verifying analytics, fixing unfollow tracking, and correcting the Intermed. text color.
