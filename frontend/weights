The trajectory begins with a summary of prior work: fixing a carousel reset bug in , memoizing  in , and addressing an incorrect content display for the build explosion based path, including refactoring  and fixing a cart  display issue.

A new critical bug was then reported (Chat Message 5): the I want to sweat weights path was erroneously displaying content from build explosion based. The AI engineer investigated, identifying that  was routing both paths to the same  screen (Chat Message 9-12). The solution proposed was to create a dedicated  and a corresponding , then update the routing in  (Chat Message 14, 16).

Upon user confirmation and provision of extensive workout data (Chat Message 17), the AI engineer executed this plan: creating the new data and equipment files (Chat Message 19, 21), updating 's routing (Chat Message 23, 25), and finally, refactoring  to utilize the new  by replacing its previous inline data. This replacement process required multiple steps, including using bash commands for cleanup due to the large data size (Chat Message 26-53). The frontend was then restarted (Chat Message 55).

The application is designed to offer an interactive workout experience across various categories such as Light weights, Calisthenics, Outdoor, Cardio, and Muscle Gainer. It features a Workout Shopping Cart that leads to a workout guidance screen. Initially, the Add to Cart functionality was implemented for Light weights and specific Muscle gainer sub-paths, with the cart displaying a mood card title and truncated workout sub-path, later refined to show total workout count and estimated duration.

Recent development extended Add to Cart to Muscle gainer - Biceps, Triceps, and Legs workouts and integrated it into the Im feeling lazy" path for "body weight" workout cards. A persistent UI bug involving carousel resets and button flashing in the "cardio based > light weights" path when adding workouts beyond the first card also needed resolution, with the expected behavior being a checkmark without carousel movement.

A critical issue involved the "build explosion > weights based" path incorrectly displaying "light weights" content. This required implementing the correct workout data for specific equipment (Power Lifting Platform, Landmine Attachment, Dumbbells, Kettlebells, Chains / Bands, Trap Hex Bar) with 3-4 workouts per intensity level. The UI/UX for this path also needed restoration to match the "muscle gainer > abs path" screen format (header, progress bar, workout card layout, functionality), and the progress bars workout type needed to correctly reflect Build Explosion - Weight Based.
