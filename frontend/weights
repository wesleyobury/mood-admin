The AI engineer's initial focus was resolving a carousel reset/button flashing bug in . This involved refactoring  outside the main component and memoizing  in . Following this, the user reported a critical issue: the build explosion based path incorrectly displayed light weights content.

The AI engineer systematically addressed this by:
1.  Identifying the misconfigured navigation and data sources across , , and .
2.  Updating  with correct equipment and routing.
3.  Creating  to store new workout data.
4.  Refactoring  (which initially failed due to file truncation/duplication issues) by copying the correct UI structure from  and integrating the new explosiveness data.
5.  Fixing subsequent errors, including a leftover  reference and an incorrect hardcoded Muscle gainer mood in the cart item for this path. The current state is that the cart mood display fix has been applied, and the frontend restarted.

The application provides an interactive workout experience across paths like Light weights, Calisthenics, Outdoor, Cardio, and Muscle Gainer, featuring a Workout Shopping Cart that leads to a workout guidance screen. Initially, Add to Cart was implemented for Light weights and specific Muscle gainer sub-paths. The cart displayed a mood card title and truncated workout sub-path, later refined to show specific leg groups (e.g., Legs - Compound) and then only total workout count and estimated duration.

The ongoing work involved extending Add to Cart to Muscle gainer - Biceps, Triceps, and Legs workouts while maintaining UI/UX consistency. A critical task was integrating Add to Cart into the Im feeling lazy" path for "body weight" workout cards, and fixing a persistent UI glitch: carousel resets and button flashing when clicking "Add Workout" on cards beyond the first in the "cardio based > light weights" path. The expected behavior is a checkmark without carousel movement.

More recently, the "build explosion > weights based" path was found to display incorrect content (from "I want to sweat > light weights"). This required implementing the correct workout data for "Power Lifting Platform," "Landmine Attachment," "Dumbbells," "Kettlebells," "Chains / Bands," and "Trap Hex Bar," ensuring 3-4 workouts per intensity level. Furthermore, the UI/UX for this "weights based" path was altered and needed to be restored to match the "muscle gainer > abs path" screen format, including header, progress bar, workout card layout, and functionality. Finally, the progress bars workout type needed to correctly reflect Build Explosion - Weight Based.
