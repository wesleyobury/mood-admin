The trajectory outlines the transition of work from an AI engineer to a human expert. The initial phase focused on completing Add to Cart functionality across various workout paths (calisthenics, outdoor) and resolving associated styling and Metro bundler errors. The user then confirmed previous fixes. Subsequently, the AI engineer implemented a global Home button navigation by creating a  component and systematically integrating it into over 45 workout screens, including manual adjustments for unique header layouts (, ). This was followed by a series of UI/UX refinements: adjusting bottom padding on Your Workouts screens, transforming Workout Type screens to use a Selected: xxx block with a Continue button, and standardizing equipment displays to a vertical stacked format (e.g., Cardio, Back, Shoulders, Chest) to match existing patterns. The final tasks involved applying the Selected: xxx and Continue block pattern to Build explosion and Im feeling lazy" training type screens, which included significant refactoring and style updates. The trajectory concludes with the AI restarting the Expo service after the latest UI updates.

The application delivers an interactive workout experience across diverse categories (Light weights, Calisthenics, Outdoor, Cardio, Muscle Gainer), integrating a "Workout Shopping Cart" that guides users to a "workout guidance" screen. The cart tracks total workout count and duration. Key features previously implemented include "Add to Cart" for "Muscle gainer - Biceps, Triceps, Legs" and "Im feeling lazy weight workouts, addressing routing issues for light weights, fixing carousel reset bugs, and refining workout card aesthetics.

Current and recent development focused on:
1. Extending Add to Cart functionality to Im feeling lazy > lift weights" (upper, lower, full body), "calisthenics path", and "outdoor activities" workouts, ensuring consistent button styling and cart display (body part details, no title truncation).
2. Implementing a global "Home" button in the top-right corner of all workout screens to navigate back to the main mood card home screen.
3. Decreasing excessive bottom padding on the "workout type" screen (e.g., Cardio/Light weights selection) and "your workouts" display screens across "I want to sweat" and "Muscle Gainer" paths (including the specific Legs flow) for a tighter UI.
4. Redesigning "workout type" screens in "I want to sweat", "Build explosion", and "Im feeling lazy paths to feature a Selected: xxx block and a Continue button, similar to the Muscle Gainer path.
5. Changing equipment display in sweat based and Muscle Gainer Shoulders, Chest paths from square grid cards to a vertical stacked format, matching the layout and spacing of Abs equipment and Light weights paths.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the Selected: xxx block and Continue button pattern for two key training type screens:  (for the Build explosion mood card path) and  (for the Im feeling lazy" mood card path).

For both screens, the work involved:
1.  **State Management**: Introducing `useState` to manage the `selectedOption`, which stores the currently chosen training type.
2.  **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying a `SelectedBlock` component only when an option has been selected, showing the `selectedOption.name`.
3.  **Navigation and Action**: Implementing a `Continue` button that, when pressed, navigates the user to the next screen, passing the `selectedOption.id` as a parameter.
4.  **Component Refactoring**: Restructuring the main components render logic to incorporate the new selection UI elements, including to render the options and wrap them in to handle selection.
