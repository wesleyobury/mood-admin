The trajectory details the AI engineer's continuous development of an Expo mobile application, focusing on implementing consistent swipe and dot indicator functionality for workout cards across various workout paths. Initially, the engineer was tasked with fixing leg workout cards, which involved debugging  and  to synchronize dot indicators with 's  and , and setting workout duration text to golden.

Subsequently, the user introduced three new feature requests:
1.  **Explosion > Body Weight Path**: Ensure  has correct swipe functionality and dot synchronization without altering styling.
2.  **I'm Feeling Lazy > Move Your Body Path**: Apply the same swipe and dot fixes to , , , and .
3.  **Calisthenics and Outdoor Moodcards**: Implement identical swipe and dot behavior for  and .

For each new request, the AI engineer consistently followed a pattern: inspecting the relevant file(s) for outdated  or touch-based swipe implementations, comparing them to a known working implementation (e.g., ), updating the  to use , , , , removing redundant touch handling logic, and finally restarting the frontend to apply changes. The process involved meticulous file inspections and targeted code modifications to standardize the interactive workout card experience. The trajectory concludes with the engineer completing the changes for the calisthenics and outdoor workouts, preparing to provide a summary.

**New User Requests during this trajectory:**
9.  **Bodyweight Explosiveness Path**: Implement swipe functionality and dot synchronization for workout cards in build explosion weight path (). *Styling/formatting must not be altered.*
10. **Lazy Path Workouts**: Apply consistent swipe functionality and dot synchronization to all workout cards in Im feeling lazy > move your body" path (`lazy-upper-body-workouts.tsx`, `lazy-full-body-workouts.tsx`, `lazy-bodyweight-workouts.tsx`, `lazy-lower-body-workouts.tsx`).
11. **Calisthenics & Outdoor Workouts**: Implement consistent swipe functionality and dot synchronization for workout cards in "calisthenics" and "I want to get outside" moodcards (`calisthenics-workouts.tsx`, `outdoor-workouts.tsx`).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Expo File-Based Routing (`expo-router`)**: For screen navigation.
-   **React Native Components**: `FlatList` for performant, swipeable lists; `View`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, `Image`.
-   **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`.
-   **FlatList Viewability**: `onViewableItemsChanged`, `onScroll`, `scrollToOffset`, `viewabilityConfig` for carousel-like behavior and dot synchronization.
-   **Flexbox Styling**: For UI layouts.

<pending_tasks>
- The user needs to confirm that the fixes applied to `calisthenics-workouts.tsx` and `outdoor-workouts.tsx` (swipe synchronization and dot indicator updates) are now reflected and working as expected.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the users request to ensure consistent swipe functionality and dot indicator synchronization for workout cards in the calisthenics and I want to get outside moodcard paths.
