The trajectory details an iterative, user-driven process to add images to workout cards within a new section of a fitness application: Lazy Weights Body. The user initiated this task after a previous one (Just Move Your Body) was completed. The AI's first action was to identify the correct file to modify. After a brief exploration, it located , which, like the previous file, follows a monolithic pattern with hardcoded workout data.

The core of the work involved updating this single file in multiple phases, dictated by the user. The user provided images in batches for three distinct sub-categories: Press, Pull, and Full Upper Body. For each batch, the AI mapped the labeled images to the corresponding workout objects (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced), executed a series of  commands to add the  property, and restarted the Expo server to apply the changes. The AI demonstrated adaptability by handling partial updates, clearly communicating which workouts were still missing images, and then completing the work when the remaining assets were provided. The entire Upper Body section, comprising 27 workouts, was successfully updated. The user's language is English, and future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to enhance the user experience of the Lazy Weights Body workout path by adding relevant images to every workout card. This path is broken down into three sub-categories: Press, Pull, and Full Upper Body, each with nine workouts split across Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced difficulty levels.

The product owner (the user) drives this feature by providing all necessary image assets in batches. The images are labeled to indicate which specific workout card they belong to. The engineer's task is to modify the application's hardcoded workout data to insert the provided image URLs into the  field for all 27 corresponding workout objects. This will create a more visually engaging and intuitive interface for this section of the app. The implementation for the entire Upper Body path has been completed.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Monolithic Component Structure**: The workout data and the React Native rendering logic are co-located in a single  file for the entire Upper Body section.
- **Hardcoded Data Model**: All workout details are stored in a large, static array of JavaScript objects directly within the component file.
- **Iterative, User-Driven Workflow**: Development follows a strict pattern: receive assets from the user, perform targeted file edits, restart the server, and confirm completion for each sub-task.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The architecture for this feature follows a monolithic pattern where view logic and data are tightly coupled within a single file. The AI identified the relevant file after a short exploration.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the central file for the entire Upper Body task. It contains a large, hardcoded array of 27 workout objects for the Press, Pull, and Full Upper Body categories. It also includes the React Native code to render this data. It was the sole target for all content update operations during this trajectory.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was modified extensively. The  property was added to all 27 workout objects across the three categories and their respective difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). The changes were made in multiple batches as the user provided images for each workout group (Press, Pull, Full Upper Body).

- ** files**
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: Other files like  and  were part of the initial codebase context. Reading the directory listing helped the AI understand the file naming convention and quickly locate the correct  file to work on.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: No changes were made to these other files during this task.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding pending tasks. All user requests to add images to the Lazy Weights Body path (including Press, Pull, and Full Upper Body sections) have been fully completed. The AI is awaiting the user's next directive.

<current_work>
The most recent and final task was completing the Full Upper Body workout section, which finalized the user's overall goal for the entire Upper Body path.

1.  **User Request**: The user provided two images for the remaining workouts:  (for cluster stack) and  (for cable finsih).
2.  **File Edited**: .
3.  **Actions Performed**: The AI located the final two Advanced level  workout objects in the file (Cluster Stack and Cable Finish). It then executed two  commands to add the  property to each, using the provided images.
4.  **Final Action**: After the properties were added, the AI restarted the Expo server with expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started and sent a final, comprehensive summary confirming that all 27 workouts in the Press, Pull, and Full Upper Body sections were complete.
5.  **Where the work left off**: The process concluded after the final summary message, which asked the user for the next task.
