Key formatting fixes needed for chest workout battle plans:

CURRENT FORMAT → PROPER FORMAT:
'3 rounds:\n• exercise' → '• 3 rounds:\n  • exercise'
'4 rounds:\n• exercise' → '• 4 rounds:\n  • exercise'  
'2 rounds:\n• exercise' → '• 2 rounds:\n  • exercise'

All exercises within rounds should be indented with 2 spaces:

  • Rest 60s

Drop sets format:
  • 8 heavy exercise
  • Drop → 10 moderate  
  • Drop → 12 light
